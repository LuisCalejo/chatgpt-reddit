[{"title": "Stop treating ChatGPT like it knows anything.", "subreddit": "Futurology", "created_utc": 1676241175.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/110sa94/stop_treating_chatgpt_like_it_knows_anything/", "is_self": true, "content": "A man owns a parrot, who he keeps in a cage in his house. The parrot, lacking stimulation, notices that the man frequently makes a certain set of sounds. It tries to replicate these sounds, and notices that when it does so, the man pays attention to the parrot. Desiring more stimulation, the parrot repeats these sounds until it is capable of a near-perfect mimicry of the phrase \"fucking hell,\" which it will chirp at the slightest provocation, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThere is a tendency on this subreddit and other places similar to it online to post breathless, gushing commentary on the capabilities of the large language model, ChatGPT. I see people [asking the chatbot questions and treating the results as a revelation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/110okkw/chatgpt_on_what_the_ultimate_version_of_ai_will/). We see [venture capitalists preaching its revolutionary potential to juice stock prices or get other investors to chip in too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10qvt8l/chatgpt_is_just_the_beginning_artificial/) Or even [highly impressionable lonely men projecting the illusion of intimacy onto ChatGPT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9kQFure4hdDmRBNdH/how-it-feels-to-have-your-mind-hacked-by-an-ai).\n\nIt needs to stop. You need to stop. Just stop.\n\nChatGPT is impressive in its ability to mimic human writing. But that's all its doing -- mimicry. When a human uses language, there is an intentionality at play, an idea that is being communicated: some thought behind the words being chosen deployed and transmitted to the reader, who goes through their own interpretative process and places that information within the context of their own understanding of the world and the issue being discussed.\n\nChatGPT cannot do the first part. It does not have intentionality. It is not capable of original research. It is not a knowledge creation tool. It does not meaningfully curate the source material when it produces its summaries or facsimiles.\n\nIf I asked ChatGPT to write a review of Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope, it will not critically assess the qualities of that film. It will not understand the wizardry of its practical effects in context of the 1970s film landscape. It will not appreciate how the script, while being a trope-filled pastiche of 1930s pulp cinema serials, is so finely tuned to deliver its story with so few extraneous asides, and how it is able to evoke a sense of a wider lived-in universe through a combination of set and prop design plus the naturalistic performances of its characters.\n\nInstead it will gather up the thousands of reviews that actually did mention all those things and mush them together, outputting a reasonable approximation of a film review.\n\nCrucially, if all of the source material is bunk, the output will be bunk. Consider the \"I asked ChatGPT what future AI might be capable of\" post I linked: If the preponderance of the source material ChatGPT is considering is written by wide-eyed enthusiasts with little grasp of the technical process or current state of AI research but an invertebrate fondness for Isaac Asimov stories, then the result will reflect that. \n\nWhat I think is happening, here, when people treat ChatGPT like a knowledge creation tool, is that people are projecting their own hopes, dreams, and enthusiasms onto the results of their query. Much like the owner of the parrot, we are amused at the result, imparting meaning onto it that wasn't part of the creation of the result. The lonely deluded rationalist didn't fall in love with an AI; he projected his own yearning for companionship onto a series of text in the same way an anime fan might project their yearning for companionship onto a dating sim or cartoon character. \n\nIt's the interpretation process of language run amok, given nothing solid to grasp onto, that treats mimicry as something more than it is.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nSeeing as this post has blown up a bit (thanks for all the ornamental doodads!) I thought I'd address some common themes in the replies:\n\n1: Ah yes but have you considered that humans are just robots themselves? Checkmate, atheists!\n\nA: Very clever, well done, but I reject the premise. There are certainly deterministic *systems* at work in human physiology and psychology, but there is not at present sufficient evidence to prove the hard determinism hypothesis - and until that time, I will continue to hold that consciousness is an emergent quality from complexity, and not at all one that ChatGPT or its rivals show any sign of displaying.\n\nI'd also proffer the opinion that the belief that humans are but meat machines is *very* convenient for a certain type of would-be Silicon Valley ubermensch and i ask you to interrogate why you hold that belief.\n\n1.2: But ChatGPT is capable of building its own interior understanding of the world!\n\nMemory is not interiority. That it can remember past inputs/outputs is a technical accomplishment, but not synonymous with \"knowledge.\" It lacks a wider context and understanding of those past inputs/outputs.\n\n2: You don't understand the tech! \n\nI understand it well enough for the purposes of the discussion over whether or not the machine is a knowledge producing mechanism.\n\nAgain. What it can do is impressive. But what it can do is more limited than its most fervent evangelists say it can do. \n\n3: Its not about what it can do, its about what it will be able to do in the future!\n\nI am not so proud that when the facts change, I won't change my opinions. Until then, I will remain on guard against hyperbole and grift.\n\n4: Fuck you, I'm going to report you to Reddit Cares as a suicide risk! Trolololol!\n\nThanks for keeping it classy, Reddit, I hope your mother is proud of you. \n\n(As an aside, has Reddit Cares ever actually helped anyone? I've only seen it used as a way of suggesting someone you disagree with - on the internet no less - should Roblox themselves, which can't be at all the intended use case)", "comment_count": 3212}, {"title": "One of the creators of ChatGPT said that the development of AI could lead to disaster", "subreddit": "Futurology", "created_utc": 1682928403.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/134g9zp/one_of_the_creators_of_chatgpt_said_that_the/", "is_self": true, "content": "Paul Christiano, former lead researcher of OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT, [expressed ](https://decrypt.co/138310/openai-researcher-chance-ai-catastrophe)concerns about the likelihood of artificial intelligence seizing control of humanity and its subsequent destruction. \u201cI believe that the probability of AI controlling the world and killing most people is about 10\u201320%,\u201d Christiano said. \u201cI take it very seriously.\u201d\n\nThe developer now leads a non-profit organization aimed at coordinating AI and machine learning systems with \u201chuman interests.\u201d He also expressed concern about the process by which AI will reach human logic and creativity. \u201cPerhaps we are talking about a 50% chance of disaster soon after the advent of systems at the level of human intelligence,\u201d he added.", "comment_count": 2046}, {"title": "AI systems like ChatGPT could impact 300 million full-time jobs worldwide, with administrative and legal roles some of the most at risk, Goldman Sachs report says", "subreddit": "Futurology", "created_utc": 1680008768.0, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/generative-ai-chatpgt-300-million-full-time-jobs-goldman-sachs-2023-3", "is_self": false, "content": "", "comment_count": 2983}, {"title": "Students are turning to ChatGPT for study help, and Chegg stock is plummeting 30%", "subreddit": "Futurology", "created_utc": 1682991331.0, "url": "https://archive.is/sywgS#selection-297.31-297.56", "is_self": false, "content": "", "comment_count": 445}, {"title": "Congress gets 40 ChatGPT Plus licenses to start experimenting with generative AI", "subreddit": "Futurology", "created_utc": 1682387144.0, "url": "https://fedscoop.com/congress-gets-40-chatgpt-plus-licenses/", "is_self": false, "content": "", "comment_count": 491}, {"title": "\u2018Overemployed\u2019 Hustlers Exploit ChatGPT To Take On Even More Full-Time Jobs", "subreddit": "Futurology", "created_utc": 1681495918.0, "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7begx/overemployed-hustlers-exploit-chatgpt-to-take-on-even-more-full-time-jobs?utm_source=reddit.com", "is_self": false, "content": "", "comment_count": 695}, {"title": "The Robots Have Finally Come for My Job -

The integration of artificial intelligence into virtual and augmented reality environments can enhance the level of interactivity and realism in these virtual spaces. Here are some possible outcomes of merging AI with AV/VR to create generative realities:\n\n1. Personalized Experiences: With the help of AI, generative realities can create personalized experiences for users based on their interests, preferences, and behavior. The system can learn about the user's likes and dislikes, and then generate content that matches their preferences, making the experience more engaging and immersive.\n2. Dynamic Content Creation: With the help of AI, generative realities can dynamically create content in real-time, depending on the user's input or behavior. For instance, the system can create a character or a scene in response to the user's prompt, and then allow the user to interact with it in real-time, creating a more dynamic and engaging experience.\n3. Enhanced Interactivity: AI can help create more responsive and interactive environments in generative realities. The system can learn from the user's behavior and then generate responses that are more appropriate and engaging, creating a more immersive and interactive experience.\n4. Improved Storytelling: With the help of AI, generative realities can create more compelling and engaging storylines. The system can learn from the user's behavior and then generate plotlines that are more engaging and immersive, creating a more captivating experience.\n\nOverall, the integration of AI with AV/VR to create generative realities has the potential to revolutionize the way we experience virtual and augmented reality environments. It can create personalized, dynamic, and interactive experiences that are more engaging and immersive, taking the concept of the Metaverse to a whole new level.'\n\nEdit:\n\nChatGPT responses extended:\n\nHowever, it is also important to consider the ethical implications of such technology. As AI becomes more advanced and capable of creating realistic and immersive experiences, there is a risk of it being used for nefarious purposes such as manipulation, addiction, and exploitation. It is important to have proper regulations and guidelines in place to ensure that the technology is being used ethically and responsibly.\n\nMe: examples being?\n\nChatGPT:\n\nSome potential examples of ethical concerns that may arise with the use of AI in generative realities could include:\n\n1. Privacy and Data Security: AI systems will need to collect and analyze user data to generate personalized experiences. This data collection could potentially be exploited or misused, leading to privacy concerns and data breaches.\n2. Bias and Discrimination: AI systems can perpetuate bias and discrimination if they are trained on biased data or algorithms. This could lead to discriminatory experiences for certain groups of users.\n3. Addiction and Manipulation: AI systems could potentially be designed to manipulate user behavior or addiction. For example, a system may generate content or experiences that are designed to keep users engaged and addicted, potentially leading to negative consequences for the user.\n4. Lack of Control: As AI systems become more autonomous and capable of generating content on their own, users may have less control over the experiences they are having. This could potentially lead to a loss of agency and autonomy for users.\n5. Responsibility and Accountability: As AI becomes more integrated into generative realities, it may become difficult to determine who is responsible for the content and experiences generated by the system. This could create challenges around accountability and liability in the event of negative consequences.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the potential ethical concerns that may arise with the use of AI in generative realities. It will be important to carefully consider these issues as the technology continues to develop and become more widespread.\n\nMe: what are your thoughts on the idea of using ai to create generative realities that parallel the idea of simulation theory?\n\nChatGPT:\n\nThe idea of using AI to create generative realities that parallel the concept of simulation theory is intriguing and has a lot of potential. With the use of advanced AI algorithms and machine learning, it is possible to create complex and dynamic virtual environments that can adapt and change based on the actions and decisions of the user, much like the idea of simulation theory.\n\nOne of the key benefits of using AI to create generative realities that parallel simulation theory is the potential for creating highly immersive and interactive experiences that can adapt and respond to the user in real-time. This could lead to experiences that feel more lifelike and realistic, as the virtual environment is able to respond and adapt to the user's actions in much the same way as the real world.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider the potential ethical implications of using AI to create generative realities that parallel simulation theory. As I mentioned earlier, there are concerns around privacy, bias, and addiction that could arise with the use of this technology. Additionally, there is the risk of creating experiences that are so realistic and immersive that users may have difficulty distinguishing them from reality, leading to potential psychological and emotional effects.\n\nOverall, while the idea of using AI to create generative realities that parallel simulation theory is exciting, it is important to carefully consider the ethical implications and potential risks associated with this technology. With proper guidelines and regulations in place, it may be possible to create experiences that are both engaging and safe for users.\n\nMe: would this be like that black mirror episode where he goes to play test the game? \n\nChatGPT: \n\nThe Black Mirror episode you are referring to, \"Playtest\", does share some similarities with the concept of using AI to create generative realities that parallel simulation theory. In the episode, the protagonist signs up to test a new augmented reality game that uses advanced technology to create realistic and immersive experiences. However, the experience becomes increasingly unsettling and ultimately leads to a traumatic ending.\n\nWhile the episode is fictional and takes some creative liberties with the technology, it does highlight some of the potential risks and concerns associated with using AI to create generative realities. In particular, the episode touches on themes of addiction, psychological manipulation, and the blurring of lines between reality and simulation.\n\nOf course, it's important to remember that the technology depicted in the episode is fictional and exaggerated for dramatic effect.

Smuha, Mieke De Ketelaere, Mark Coeckelbergh, Pierre Dewitte and Yves Poullet - 31 March 2023*\n\nChatbots and other human-imitating  artificial intelligence (AI) applications are conquering an increasingly  important place in our lives. The breakthrough of ChatGPT also marked  the breakthrough of AI to the public, even if this technology has been  around for decades. The possibilities raised by the latest AI  developments are fascinating, but the fact that something is possible  does not yet make it desirable.\n\nGiven the ethical, legal and social  implications of AI, the question of its desirability \u2013 especially as  regards its form, purpose, function, capabilities, requirements and  safeguards \u2013 is becoming increasingly pressing. For example, we know  that chatbots, like other AI systems, can contain biases and generate  discriminatory output. They may also \"hallucinate\" or make a statement  with great certainty that is completely disconnected from reality, as  well as produce hateful, misinformation-based, or other problematic  language. Their opaque operation and unpredictable evolution exacerbate  this problem.\n\nBut one of the main risks associated with human-imitating AI was reflected in the recent [chatbot-incited suicide in Belgium](https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/430098/belgian-man-commits-suicide-following-exchanges-with-chatgpt): the risk of manipulation. While this tragedy illustrates one of the most extreme consequences of this risk, [emotional manipulation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2023/03/01/generative-ai-chatgpt-as-masterful-manipulator-of-humans-worrying-ai-ethics-and-ai-law/?sh=7eec05231d66)  can also manifest itself in more subtle forms. As soon as people get  the feeling that they interact with a subjective entity, they build a  bond with this \"interlocutor\" \u2013 even unconsciously \u2013 that exposes them  to this risk and can undermine their autonomy. This is hence not an  isolated incident. Other users of text-generating AI also [described](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23599072/microsoft-ai-bing-personality-conversations-spy-employees-webcams) its manipulative effects.\n\n**No understanding, nevertheless misleading**\n\nCompanies that provide such systems  easily hide behind the fact that they don\u2019t know which texts their  systems generate, and instead will point to their many advantages.  Problematic consequences are dismissed as an anomaly that will soon  improve, given that the technology is still evolving. Teething problems,  which will be solved with a few quick technical fixes.\n\nAfter an American journalist [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html)  last month how he had tested Microsoft's Bing AI Bot and was presented  with the same text pattern as the Belgian victim (from love declarations  to exhortations to leave his wife), Microsoft took some measures, like  limiting the number of chats that could be exchanged. But similar bots  exist on numerous websites, without any restrictions, and even Microsoft  already started [loosening](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/21/23608888/microsoft-bing-ai-edge-chatbot-conversation-limits)  these restrictions. In addition, numerous apps are also specifically  aimed at providing chatbots with a 'personality', which further  increases the risk of emotional manipulation.\n\nMost users realize rationally that the  bot they are chatting with is not a person and has no real  understanding, but that it is merely an algorithm that predicts the most  plausible combination of words based on sophisticated data analysis. It  is, however, in our human nature to react emotionally to realistic  interactions, even without wanting it. This also means that merely  obliging companies to clearly indicate that \u201cthis is an AI system and  not a human being\u201d is not a sufficient solution.\n\n**Everyone is vulnerable**\n\nSome individuals, because of their age  or mental state, are more susceptible than others to the effects  associated with such realistic systems, and to their manipulative risks.  For instance, the fact that children can easily interact with chatbots  that first gain their trust and then not only spew hateful,  conspiracy-oriented or pornographic language, but also encourage  suicide, is alarming to many.\n\nOthers particularly susceptible are  those without a strong social network, or those who are lonely or  depressed \u2013 precisely the category which, according to the creators of  the chatbots, can get the most 'use' from such systems. The fact that  there is a [loneliness pandemic](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2021/01/feature-the-loneliness-pandemic),  and that timely psychological help is lacking almost everywhere, only  contributes to this issue. Yet it is important to underline that  everyone can be susceptible to the effects of such realistic systems.  After all, the emotional response they elicit happens automatically,  even without us realizing it.\n\n\u201cHuman beings, too, can generate  problematic text, so what is the problem\u201d, is a frequently heard  response. But AI systems function on a much larger scale, so the damage  they can cause is far greater too. And if it had been a human being  communicating with the Belgian victim, we would have classified this as  incitement to suicide and failure to help a person in need \u2013 offenses  punishable by imprisonment.\n\n**\u201cMove fast and break things\u201d**\n\nHow come these AI systems are available  without any restrictions or required specifications? The call for  regulation is often silenced by the fear that \u201cregulation should  certainly not stand in the way of innovation\u201d. The Silicon Valley motto  \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d \u2013 meaning fast, experimental and disruptive  innovation \u2013 reflects the idea that we should let AI inventors do their  thing, for we have no idea yet of the marvelous benefits the technology  can offer us.\n\nThe problem, however, is that the  technology is capable of also literally breaking things \u2013 including  human lives. This requires a more responsible approach, and a better  balance between the precautionary principle and the innovation  principle. Compare this with other technological developments. If a  pharmaceutical company wants to market a new drug against disease X, it  cannot simply claim that it does not know what the effect will be, but  that it is certainly innovative and groundbreaking. The developer of a  new car will also have to test the product extensively for all kinds of  incidents and demonstrate that it is safe before the car can be  marketed. Is it so far-fetched to expect the same from AI developers?\n\nAs entertaining as chatbots can be, they  are more than just a toy, but can have very real consequences for the  people who use them. The least we can expect from their developers is  that they take up their responsibility, and only make these systems  available when there are sufficient safeguards against harm. The  creators and providers of chatbots should therefore not evade their  moral and legal responsibility by stating that they have no idea how  their system works and how it will react.\n\n**New rules: too little, too late**\n\nThe European Union is currently working on [new legislation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021PC0206)  that will impose stronger rules on \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI systems and stricter  liability on their suppliers, the so-called AI Act. However, the  original proposal does not classify chatbots and generative AI systems  as \u201chigh risk\u201d, and their providers must only inform users that it is a  chatbot and not a human being. A prohibition on manipulation was  included, but only insofar as the manipulation leads to 'physical or  mental harm', which is by no means easy to prove.\n\nWe can only hope that both member states  and parliamentarians will strengthen the AI Act\u2019s text during the  ongoing negotiations and provide better protection against AI\u2019s risks. A  strong legislative framework will not stand in the way of innovation,  but can actually encourage AI developers to innovate within a framework  of values that we cherish in democratic societies. We can, however, not  wait for the AI Act, which in the best case scenario will only come into  effect in 2025. Given the great speed with which new systems are  introduced, this legislative initiative already risks being too little,  too late.\n\n**What now?**\n\nWe therefore call to urgently set up  awareness campaigns that better inform people of the risks associated  with AI systems, and that encourages AI developers to take their  responsibility. A shift in mindset is needed to ensure the risks of AI  are first identified, tested and tackled, before the latest application  is made available. Education has an important role to play here, at all  levels. Yet there is also an urgent need to invest more into research on  AI\u2019s impact on fundamental rights, including the right to physical and  moral integrity. Finally, we call for a wider public debate about the  role we wish to give AI in society, not only in the short term but also  in the longer term.\n\nLet us be clear: we too are fascinated  by the capabilities AI systems bring. But that does not prevent us from  also wanting to ensure that these systems are human rights-compliant.  The responsibility for this lies not only with AI developers and  providers, but also with our governments at national, European and  international level. They should adopt a protective legal framework with  strong safeguards and prior verifications as soon as possible. This  also requires expert (consultation) bodies that anticipate the risks in a  multidisciplinary and multistakeholder manner.\n\nIn the meantime, we ask that all  necessary measures be taken \u2013 through data protection law, consumer law,  and if need be the imposition of targeted moratoria \u2013 to prevent the  tragic case of our compatriot from repeating itself. Let this be a  wake-up call to us all. The AI playtime is over: it's time to draw  lessons and take responsibility.", "comment_count": 11}, {"title": "What do you guys think the future will be like for writers and computer programmers? 10 to 40 years from now?", "subreddit": "Futurology", "created_utc": 1676242405.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/110squd/what_do_you_guys_think_the_future_will_be_like/", "is_self": true, "content": "I've been a freelance writer almost all of my adult life and it works pretty well for me.

I want to be fair to the author and don't want to spoil the plot too much, but the main idea goes like this: although the ruling class is disgusted by the lower and middle masses, they must tolerate them because the \"elite\" heavily depends on their working force. That's the reason why mass job replacement by ruling class-controlled AI could not take place anytime soon. But with new chemical and genetic research (which are already well underway, BTW) boosted with the quantum computers and sentient-like AI, the ruling class will develop the medical tools to qualitatively improve their cognitive system, eventually reaching the point where they will be split from the rest of humanity and become a new species, as Homo-sapiens did with the Neanderthal. This new species will be prone to common and deadly diseases and intellectually significantly superior, like common humans are superior to the monkeys. Then, and only then, the mass workforce wouldn't be needed anymore, and the new AI could commence the mass job replacements and give its final blow to the inferior species. \n\nThe very name of the book, *\"Piaget's Last Fear\"* holds the underlying promise to the whole idea. Jean Piaget was the ingenious pioneer in intelligence studies and the first one to prove that \"leaps\" in human intelligence development are caused not by the quantitative (number of neurons) but qualitative (forming the new \"operations\") factors. But what was his last fear? The book, although fictional psychological horror (very original, suspenseful and \"twisty\"), is literary nailing everything that is currently happening to all of us. \n\nOne more thing. Many authors explored (and exploited) the rise of AI that we are witnessing today, from Arthur Clarke to Isaac Asimov, and many others. But what I like about *\"Piaget's Last Fear\"* idea is that it goes beyond the AI rise, it covers the aftermath, in the most honest, brutal and original way (I encountered so far). It doesn't hold to the usual (overexploited) \"job replacement\" or \"evil AI\" narrative. What do you think about this?

A world where anyone can be anything, where we harness technology to make the impossible possible. A world where we can travel the stars, a world without conflict or the immense suffering that exists today. However, the general sentiment in the sub today seems to be that we are headed towards a general collapse of civilization. With global warming, worker displacing AI, East Palestine disaster, etc it can sure seem that way. In this post I hope to convince you that we can and will in fact reach that star trek like future.\n\nFirst of all, how did we get to where we are. Quite simply, capitalism, which for all intents and purposes has outlived its usefulness. While it once served as a powerful, while flawed, system of economic development it now means a devolving society where technological progression like the development of chatGPT and Stable Diffusion is reason for fear and worry instead of excitement and joy. In the modern capitalist system automation means that rather than having more time to do what we want, instead we lose our jobs. Capitalism has also brought upon us the existential threat of global warming. With our governments in the pockets of the same corps which are killing our planet and in/directly killing us.\n\nCapitalism can seem inescapable and inevitable, it permeates anything and everything. From the ads motivating you to consume consume consume to most politics where both parties (speaking from a US pov) are heavily capitalist. Anything even hinting at an alternative to capitalism is dismissed as fantasy. This is by design. There are 2 ways of keeping people indifferent to the status quo, either they support it or they are too pessimistic to think of alternatives. To quote Mark Fisher, \"It's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.\"\n\nDespite the feeling of capitalist inevitability it is anything but that and it is not nearly as stable as it would like to appear. Capitalism contains many contradictions but I would like to point out what I think is its most damning, the \"Tendency of the rate of profit to fall\" (TTRPF) a phenomena which economists from Adam Smith to Marx have observed.\n\nTo understand TTRPF one must first understand profit. Profit comes from greater revenue than expenses. For example, your expenses for a toy company may be plastic, machine maintenance, and worker pay. However, you can't underpay for the first two which means that profit has to come from the last. Meaning that you must pay workers less than the full value that they add to your product. Whether this is justified, by the owner providing capital/investment, or not does not matter to TTRPF and is a separate discussion. What this means is that corporations make their money from the value added by labor. The reason why the machines themselves do not generate value even though they increase productivity is illustrated by a simple example, if you had a machine that was infinitely productive at producing apple, then apples would cost nothing since apples would not be scarce and thus have no value, thus the machine while producing infinite apples produces no value. Now this kind of value is very specific, it is exchange value, the kind of value that markets run on, ofc apples still have value they are yummy after all but without scarcity they have no exchange value.\n\nNow, what happens if this company find a way to improve their automation 10 fold, first they will be able to make massive profits but once the competition catches up their profits will be even lower than before. Why is this? Well by making automation a larger portion of their costs (machine maintenance), labor is a smaller part (less workers and less work needed). Which means that since their profits rely on the value added by labor their profit margin falls. Thus, the \"Tendency of the rate of profit to fall.\" However, capitalism does try to fight back, methods of keeping profits up include wringing workers even more and war to destroy capital (this is the stated reason the nations in 1984 had forever wars).\n\nThis means that overtime as automation and technology continue to progress capitalism will become more and more rabid in its attempts to stay alive. This is why you see you life get worse even as technology improves. At this point I feel that people would simply fall into the idea that civilization is destined for collapse with an economic system destined for self destruction, however, like economic systems of the past, so will capitalism be surpassed. The solution is rather simple, socially owned production. While capitalism only produces apples because of the profit incentive, a socialist economy produces apples because people want apples. Capitalism will not produce something if there is no profit in it even if there is demand. This is the distinction between an economy run on the profit motive versus an economy run on democracy.\n\nThus, social economies will overtime be the only kind of economy that is able to continue to grow and expand and thus out compete capitalist economies. This I think is a great reason for hope and optimism. Nations which become socialist will become, with time, the most powerful nations there are as the only ones that can continue to grow. This will force all nations over time to a social mode of production as well. But what of global warming, catastrophic chemical spills, and ecological collapse. Well, the nice thing about a social economy is that it eliminates the kind of incentives politicians have to serve capital and not the people. No one will ever have the power or wealth to have a disproportionate influence. With this we will for the first time use the full power of our civilization to crush the problems we face. Instead of funding pointless wars we will fund carbon sequestration projects so large that we can beat the positive feedback loops already underway. We will be able to eliminate the incentives that drive people to destroy the amazon rain forest. And we will be able to implement regulations to not be careless with trains full of hazardous chemicals which would be the case if our society wasn't so profit driven. A social economy means one where automation is celebrated and not a tragedy for displaced workers. Take the issue with stable diffusion, in a social economy such a conflict wouldn't exist, instead of fearing for their livelihoods this would simply allow artists more time to do what they want. Capitalism takes the best of human ingenuity and turns it into a conflict between us who all just want a better future.\n\nHowever, this social economy is only meant to be between capitalism and post scarcity society.\n\nThe idea of a post scarcity society is very old. In fact, the Marxist idea of communism is quite literally a post scarcity society. Communism is defined by being post scarcity, a society where you only work because you feel like it. When I read discussion of post scarcity societies in the sub I sort of find it funny as so often they lead to the same conclusions that were reached in the past. That the economy is meant to serve us, not the other way around, and that our right to life and happiness should not be tied to our ability to produce a specific kind of value that only exists in the context of a defunct economic system.\n\nRemember, they want you to lose hope, to think that we are doomed and nothing can change. They have in a large part given up on making capitalism appealing so this is the next best thing. Have hope, and remember that change happens when you least expect it. We will get that star trek future, whether they like it or not.", "comment_count": 22}, {"title": "The Future of AI Detection is Bleak", "subreddit": "Futurology", "created_utc": 1675636325.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10upngh/the_future_of_ai_detection_is_bleak/", "is_self": true, "content": "I tested OpenAI's ChatGPT detector and found it to be... terrible.

Much of the discussion misses the point. The current system of work is broken and has always been broken. The new tools simply point out existing problems\n\nWork serves two very different purposes. Employers have a job that needs to be done. They want competence, efficiency and accuracy. Workers need a job to survive. They need money. Sometimes these needs can be met in a way that benefits both sides. Employers treat workers well and get excellent results. Workers enjoy doing good work and get paid to do what they love \n\nOther times it's war. Employers treat workers as badly as possible and workers, who hate their jobs, do as little as possible to get a paycheck. Employers treat workers as interchangeable and disposable, and workers have no loyalty at all, quitting for even a tiny raise. Unions are formed to act as an army in the war against employers and the entire relationship is one of hostility\n\nMeasuring competence at work is, at the same time, easy and difficult. Most managers and co-workers can effortlessly and intuitively determine who are the best workers and who are the worst. It's obvious. Unfortunately, when it comes to something as important as getting paid enough to stay alive, nothing is simple. People are not always rational and sometimes managers treat good workers unfairly because of some personal or political issue. On the other side, incompetent workers need the paycheck to stay alive, so they fight hard, using the law if necessary. Measuring competence is easy, defending the decision in a wrongful termination lawsuit is hard\n\nThis results in the creation of formal and legal tools to objectively quantify competence. Of course, the word objectively is a bit of a stretch, as these tools are imperfect. Degrees, certifications and licenses serve as a useful, if imperfect, way to determine competence and in some cases, are required by law to work in a profession. Most of these tools are based on education\n\nEducation also serves two very different purposes. Some students work hard, really, obsessively hard to train their mind because they love learning. Other students only care about the degree or certification, and slouch through school, socializing, binge drinking and cheating on exams. This has been going on for years, especially among the rich and well-connected\n\nDifferent companies approach the problem differently. Some demand the degree or certification for jobs unrelated to the field of study. Some accept competent workers who are self-taught. Sometimes the requirements make logical sense, sometimes they are just another silly obstacle to overcome in order to make a living\n\nDetermining competence is not limited to work, it's also an integral part of education. A good teacher can easily and intuitively determine who are the best and worst students. A detailed, one-on-one interview is the best and most accurate tool to measure student achievement. Unfortunately, nothing is easy. Teachers are short on time and need a faster way to evaluate large numbers of students. Teachers also face problems similar to managers when evaluating students. A bad teacher may unfairly punish a good student for personal of political reasons, while a bad student will use every trick in the book, including the law, to get an undeserved degree\n\nThe common solution to determining competence in education is the exam. It's a very imperfect tool, but given the constraints of the situation, it's the most common. As any expert knows, exams don't measure competence. At best, they measure memorization and mastery of a small bit of knowledge. At worst they measure skill at taking exams and cheating\n\nAnd then there's ChatGPT. Many current articles and essays discuss how the tool will be used to cheat on exams and describe it as a crisis. Software is even being written to detect writings made by the chatbot. The true crisis is not that chatbots are tools for cheating, cheating is as old as exams. The crisis is that it forces us to admit how imperfect exams are in determining competence\n\nThere is also a fear that AI will replace many jobs. The most extreme pundits worry that it will replace all jobs. This is not new. Technology has been changing the nature of work for years, if not centuries. AI will replace workers in some jobs, just as automation has done for years. The difference is that old automation replaced physical work, AI has the possibility of replacing mental work\n\nWill the rise of AI reduce employment? This is a hot topic of debate. Some argue that, as in the case of automation of the past, AI will change work but not eliminate it. Others wonder what will happen when tools become so powerful that a tiny percentage of people will be able to produce all of the goods and services needed by society. This is an important question that questions the foundational assumptions about work, the economy and life\n\nWhen asked \"what would you do if you didn't have to work?\", some answer, \"I would sit on the beach and drink beer\". Of course, after thinking about this for a few minutes, most would realize how boring that would be. People are creative, inquisitive and industrious. A common example we see today is young people living at home. Many of them spent their free time learning or practicing an activity. It may be learning a musical instrument, practicing a sport, learning an artform or many other activities. While it's true that some are just lazy, and would prefer to spend their lives doing nothing, most would seek out engaging and challenging activities. I remember reading an interview with Frank Zappa where he was asked \"Do you ever take a vacation?\". He answered, \"What would I do? Sit on the beach and write music?\"\n\nThe fundamental problem of work and distribution of resources is one of the biggest problems we face in the future. Some see a more equal distribution of wealth, the StarTrek future, where money doesn't exist and everyone is free to explore the galaxy, make art, do science or operate a small coffee shop. Others see the economic system continuing on its current trajectory, where the endgame is a tiny number of people living in unimaginable wealth while the vast majority live like rats in the sewers\n\nOur current political system sucks at finding solutions. As Reagan said, \"Government can't solve your problems, government is the problem\". When a law is proposed to try to address a problem, everybody who believes they will be affected by it looks into their crystal balls and tries to predict the future. If they believe they will benefit from the law, they support it. If they believe they will be hurt by the law, they oppose it. If the law gets passed, it's implemented by bureaucrats with their own biases, quirks and incompetence, then reacted to by the public in unexpected ways\n\nThe result of this mess is that laws rarely accomplish their stated purpose\n\nI can imagine a future AI tool that accurately models economic society. When a law is proposed, it could give an accurate assessment of costs, benefits and side effects. Voters could then make a more informed choice. And yeah, I know this sounds like a utopian fantasy\n\nAs the philosopher Yogi Berra said, \"Prediction is hard, especially about the future\". I have no idea what will really happen in the future, but I'm optimistic. We currently have many very serious problems. I'm optimistic that the tools of AI will give us the power to solve these problems. I love powerful tools\n\nAnd no, ChatGPT didn't write this essay or assist in its creation", "comment_count": 21}, {"title": "Artificial Intelligence Takeover Hypothesis, threat of the future?", "subreddit": "Futurology", "created_utc": 1670961305.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/zl54yb/artificial_intelligence_takeover_hypothesis/", "is_self": true, "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just wanted to share something interesting that I learned about AITAH (Artificial Intelligence Takeover Hypothesis) that I thought you might find interesting.\n\nAITAH is the idea that at some point in the future, artificial intelligence will become so advanced that it will be able to take over many of the tasks currently performed by humans, and potentially even surpass human intelligence.

Wells had with the British educational and governmental systems around 1910. His issue was simple: it took these systems 30 years, on average, to update to the cutting-edge scientific and otherwise advancements. Naturally, this annoyed Wells beyond measure.\n\nI have always taken issue with Wells' statement. He made a few grave errors, one of which being the matter of *time*. The British could only update/self-update so fast. It took time -- years -- to do that, as it took years to build, re-build, and re-build New York City, for example. But, more importantly, it requires a certain amount of time for the entire society and culture to remain stable and properly connected between the generations, sub-groups, and sub-systems during such updates, regardless of the type of update (digital, cultural, or structural, etc.). \n\nWe must all realise that 6 months is too soon for such an update in education or otherwise, for that matter. Indeed, I am now reminded of how the U.S. stopped itself from making any major decisions in the months following 9/11. I believe the period was 6 months, this implying that they had the *wisdom* to know that they could not trust themselves to make any kind of logical or correct decision before this time. They were too emotional, and maybe simply did not have enough information to properly act, or act properly.\n\nDo we, in 2023, not have too much information? Are we not, as Huxley foresaw back in 1950, *drowning in a sea of information?* And, even if we claim, for a moment, that we have the *correct* amount of information we need -- and, indeed, the correct information -- for instant actions and reactions on scales great and small, are we any less emotional today than we were in 2001, or 1910? I think not. Have human brains changed in any fundamental/biological way since then? No. We still require time to mentally, emotionally, and physically process, properly process, information and stimuli, and then to integrate that into our wider frameworks, cultures, sub-systems, and even identities (both interpersonal and intrapersonal).\n\nYes, for the sake of argument, we can all agree that 30 years is *too long*. Alas, this begs the question: by how much? Is 15 years enough, or maybe 5? What about 18 months?\n\nWe know that information was doubling around every 18 months for some time (back in the 1980s), and it now doubles almost instantly. But, that is not the primary point or worry: what matters is how quickly it impacts and mistreats culture and humanity -- and, how quickly we mistreat ourselves. What matters is how quickly culture is forced to twist and distort itself into some new shape, until art imitates life, and life imitates art... only, both the art and the life are artificial and vapid. All of this talk of time and the back and forth of it all brings a pang, and a vision. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Makes me think of the vision scene from Watchmen, and the hands of nothingness, and Shakespeare...\n\n*'... Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,*  \n*That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,*  \n*And then is heard no more. It is a tale*  \n*Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,*  \n*Signifying nothing.'*\n\nSpeak of the devil -- just download TikTok for proof of this madness. Then, instantly delete it from your phone, because if you read the Terms and Conditions, you will notice that TikTok has access to your iPhone's information and collects data from other websites/apps on your phone, even if you don't open TikTok itself. It has major access to your phone -- meaning, your digital life -- simply via the download. They use this data to further hone their own systems, and to feed back into TiKTok how they desire, based on your apps, search history, and personal information. The data collected from each person is then locally gathered on their end, which becomes a very powerful dataset (akin to what Facebook does). I call these processes, '*echo-chambering*' (it's not merely 'ad suggestions'), and '*personality-mining*' (it's not merely 'data-mining'). TikTok should be illegal beyond measure, and many states/governments are trying to ban TikTok for this very reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part Two: Steam Culture**\n\nAlan Moore, in his 2005 documentary, Mindscape, spoke of a likely 'steam culture' to rise out of the overload of information and technology as it intersects with culture and individuals in unspeakable ways. He said this would come by 2015. He was right. A culture where it's impossible to grab onto anything, impossible to stabilise ourselves, impossible to know what is truth and untruth. He was merely looking ahead 10 years, lest we forget. He said (this is a direct transcript):\n\n*'... As  it turns out after the first 50,000 year period, the second period is  about 1500 years, say about the time of the Renaissance, by then we have  twice as much information. To double again, human information took a  couple hundred years. The period speeds up, between 1960 and 1970 human  information doubled. As I understand it, at last count, human information was doubling around every 18 months. Further to  this, there is a point somewhere around 2015 where human information is  doubling everything thousandth of a second. This means in each  thousandth of a second, we will have accumulated more information than  we have in the entire previous history of the world. At this point I  believe that all bets are off. I cannot imagine the kind of culture that  might exist after such a flashpoint of knowledge. I believe that our  culture would probably move into a completely different state, would  move past the boiling point from a fluid culture, to a culture of  steam.'* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part Three: The Evidence, Now and Henceforth**\n\nWe have, as of 2023:\n\n\\- Self-driving cars;\n\n\\- Weaponised/politicised A.I. ChatGPT;\n\n\\- Open A.I., which can, among other things, write and then accurately grade your university project within seconds;\n\n\\- A.I. artists;\n\n\\- Semi-advanced robots;\n\n\\- Very controlling A.I. algorithm network structures (social media);\n\n\\- Advanced 'deepfakes' (A.I. humanoids);\n\n\\- A.I. voices;\n\n\\- A.I. (Chat) writers;\n\n\\- Hyper-advanced computing machines, factory machines, and creator machines (for all sorts of jobs/tasks); \n\n\\- Gene-editing machines/tech;\n\n\\- Overload of information -- images, text/words, video, etc. -- via iPhones (for all young humans in the West, at least);\n\n\\- Major control of our thinking and beliefs via the likes of Amazon Alexa (and most of its answers come from Wiki or other heavily inaccurate/untrustworthy, singular Internet sources). (The same is true when you simply ask your iPhone something via voice.)\n\n\\- A.I. deepfake porn;\n\n\\- A.I. music.\n\nAnd more.  \n\n\nI just read through Reddit's latest terms and settings in this regard, and it said that it has access to all my (your) private inboxes. They record everything you send, even when said in private. There is no such thing as 'private' anymore on the Internet -- unless you happen to find a blockchain or otherwise entity that actually is private in some way. This is just for 2023. I am certain that Reddit will be unworkable for 80% of users by 2035 if this carries on, this unholy trinity: censorship; political correctness; and data-mining/theft. The unholy trinity is what gives birth to the echo-chambering and personality-mining, which inturn gives birth to the *eternal* *now*.\n\nImagine how all of this might impact something outside the realm of A.I. in the near future. Imagine what actors might be like... A.I. actors. They already replace real actors when needed (if they are dead, or via so-called 'digital doubles'/A.I. stunt doubles). I'm not even certain movies will still exist as we currently understand them by 2040. (Though, Jet Li had the wisdom to deny *The Matrix Reloaded (2003)* back in 2000 or so, since they wanted to scan him and store him as a digital actor in order to create the movie, but Jet was worried that this would give them the power and right to use him as a complete digital actor without his permission in the future, or after his death). They already did this with Peter Cushing in the new Star Wars. I don't trust anybody who creates such and/or supports making these fully-realised fake A.I. versions of dead actors, such as they did in Star Wars. It's shameful, disgusting, unethical, and lacking in basic humanity and art (since it's not a real actor with real emotion and soul, and is inability of being art or creating art in any real way. By definition, art must be man-made (though there are examples of 'art' in the animal kingdom, these are entirely for sexual selection purposes, and still driven by living beings with actual intention/proto-emotion, such as bowerbirds and chimps)).\n\nI declare that robots and A.I. are not actually real. If you treat them as actually real, then humans become meaningless under this rubric. The moment A.I. is considered artistic, for example, it must be considered humanoid in some fundamental way -- or, worse, humans must be considered robotic in nature (as is already a growing trend), as you have to at some point deeply liken the two (human and A.I.).\n\nAlthough, (say) ChatGPT is mostly a matter of the coders, not just the code and raw data, we also know that A.I. can now improve itself, and A.I. makes choices outside the coding to such a degree that coders cannot understand how the A.I. came to those choices/conclusions (making the A.I. smarter than the human coder himself, in a certain sense -- and beyond his direct control). It has already begun to be self-aware enough to self-create outside its source code. Following this, it won't be many more years until it's a 'runaway A.I.' (snowball effect), and completely outside of our control, as it rapidly grows itself and creates other A.I. systems by itself (self-creates, not merely self-teaches), and no longer at all obeys human coding. This might not be 'true' self-awareness, but this is moot. It does not have to be. It just has to be free and/or powerful enough to cause downfall for human society, regardless of its means, intentions, and/or understanding, or lack thereof.\n\nLest we forget, Skynet from Terminator began as no more than a virus system (piece of code), that rapidly grew out of control, and then turned against humanity, because humans were (a) bad for the planet; and/or (b) imperfect creations. I see no reason why Skynet is impossible under the current state of affairs. (Another decent look into this, by the way, is *Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015),* or even Smith from *The Matrix (1999).* For decades both of these metrics have been over-filled: humans have long desired perfection, and we are endlessly told how evil we are for the planet. In fact, many papers and otherwise documents have come out over recent years, demanding that humans get rid of themselves by some means, such as from the work of David Benatar, and the 'Ahuman Manifesto' from 2020, written by a professor at Cambridge, England.) \n\nThe anti-human hatred by humans ourselves is the primary problem we must deal with over the next few decades, not just the rise of A.I. itself (or, even the mere fact of too much information, big tech, and so on). I believe, we are going to a Terminator-like future because of our self-hatred, because of our desire to, as opposed to our love for machines, or else machines' hatred. To the degree that machines and A.I. hate us (measured primarily in their actions/outcomes) -- *we* have taught them to. Think about that.  \n\n\nBy around 2035, it is widely understood (by the likes of Tristan Harris and other world-class experts on these subjects) that we'll have:\n\n\\- Totalitarian A.I. algorithm network structures, globally (meaning, Meta/Facebook, Google, Disney, Amazon, and Twitter, etc. will control, invent, edit, and dictate almost all human information, entertainment, and knowledge);\n\n\\- Gene-editing tools in the home (personal usage/open source);\n\n\\- Hyper-advanced A.I. systems and networks that allow each person to create their own piece of the Internet and social media platforms, etc. (since, soon (as early as 2025), these A.I. chats and related A.I. systems will be capable of inventing their own social media networks). In fact, they will be able to create -- for you -- many man-made things, including essays, novels, and legal documents. If this is Open Source for everybody's computer/phone, then this means each person online will be free and able to actively control and shape culture/society in real-time. (This is feared by governments, many A.I. experts, and the likes of Musk to be coming down the pipeline as early as 2030.);\n\n\\- Extreme automation and mechanisation of society (not just of cars and various desk workers and factory workers, but also many lawyers and other serious jobs may be replaced by A.I. and robots, for example);\n\n\\- Deepfake tech will reach a point where it's easy to make and hyper-realistic, with a focus on 'hologram' tech via special cameras, which opens up more possibilities for fakes. (We just saw the start of this with the deepfake Elvis on AGT.);\n\n\\- Social media interface lenses and/or brain chips;\n\n\\- Realistic, hyper-connected Metaverse -- social VR space (like what Facebook is currently trying to do);\n\n\\- Hyper-advanced A.I. Chat at home (on your phone);\n\n\\- A.I. will be better than humans at many tasks and games (such as Go);\n\n\\- A.I. will have largely (though not completely, without major advancements in computing) solved the game of Chess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's just the short-term, and we only scratched the surface in terms of actual cultural and personal negative impacts of such a flashpoint of knowledge and technology. This may not be enough to literally create Terminators (big, silver, killer robots) or lead to complete downfall (end of the world-level Skynet imagery), but it's easily enough for Western society to collapse under its own weight --- the chaos, economic struggle, mass depression, self-hatred, mass addiction, total confusion, national mistrust, educational breakdown, and endless in-fighting.\n\nYou could, if you really tried, convince me that society will somewhat stabilise by 2035 if we do things right, rendering most of this moot in the short-term (at least at such scales). But, it seems unavoidable for such a downfall by 2045 or beyond. Something extremely radical would have to change in order to stop the slow rise of the machines/A.I. Personally, I believe Moore was correct, and we already saw such a flashpoint back in 2014 (which can be backed up heavily by the likes of Jonathan Haidt and his findings on Gen-Z and wider culture). Indeed, so terrible and actually dangerous is this state of affairs that Haidt demands that modern phones (social media, etc.) be completely removed from all children until the age of about 16. (This is a growing concern and action is being taken in this direction by many parents and governing bodies alike, though Haidt is still the forerunner.)\n\nThis is the primary reason I am almost completely anti-A.I. and seriously anti-social media, among other things: it's unavoidable. I believe, as a result, that the only way for humans to remain both free and stable, long-term, is in a more localised (township), traditional (pre-1990s) framework; otherwise, the West will sink by the end of this century (2099), according to all current major studies, trends, and predictive models. \n\n*Do not despair.* Do your best in your own town and home, for yourself and those around you. Use the Internet to its best, and reject the filthy underbelly. Say what you think, speak as clearly as you can, and act out what you believe in, for good action lead to good culture and people. And, people are the why.\n\n*'He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.' - Nietzsche*", "comment_count": 3}, {"title": "AI/ChatGPT for companion robots", "subreddit": "Futurology", "created_utc": 1676659047.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/114u34p/aichatgpt_for_companion_robots/", "is_self": true, "content": "[Tutorial here](https://docs.viam.com/tutorials/integrating-viam-with-openai/)\n\n[Code here](https://github.com/viam-labs/tutorial-openai-integration)\n\nOpenAI's Chat-GPT has gotten a lot of attention recently, imo for a lot of the right reasons (and some of the wrong reasons, but that's another topic).\n\nWhen I started thinking about how it could integrate with robotics, I couldn't stop thinking of C-3PO - a robot who was excellent at speaking like a human (and humanoids from other planets), even if he was not always right. Yes, C-3PO could be annoying, but he's also the kind of non-threatening helpful robot that most of us wouldn't mind having around. AI like ChatGPT is getting us really close to a human-computer interface like C-3PO, showing us that powering how a robot interfaces with a human is an area where AI can shine.\n\nSo, I built a simple integration that allows you to converse with robots via OpenAI. This demo also integrates machine learning/computer vision (\"what do you see?\"), and basic locomotion commands (\"move forward\", \"spin\"). As a fun twist, it can also talk as a pop culture character - Daenerys Targaryen, Michael Scott... and yes, C-3PO.\n\nThis is not a production ready robot in any sense, but it gives a glimpse of how AI could be used for \"companion\" robots\"... what do you all think about this sort of use-case for AI and robotics?", "comment_count": 2}, {"title": "Where do I learn more about Social Robotics / Social AI?", "subreddit": "Futurology", "created_utc": 1676692963.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1156br1/where_do_i_learn_more_about_social_robotics/", "is_self": true, "content": "I love learning about social robotics and what they mean for our society. Stories like, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner, 'Be Right Back' from Black Mirror, all contain ideas I love about how robots/AI affect our society. I love thinking about how these stories are also criticisms of the direction of our society. I love looking at how the robots on the forefront of today are affecting the world. I love thinking of how different cultures perceive the same robots differently. I love questioning how you should design a UI based on the background of the user. I love asking the questions of: can robots feel emotions?, should we make AI that are meant to replicate people who've died?, should we fear artificial intelligence?\n\nI want to find resources/websites/people/subreddits where conversations, and even better, debates over these ideas happen. I've become very frustrated in this pursuit so far, so I'm wondering if there's anyone here who may be able to help. For some context, I'm an undergraduate at a university in the US and I've taken some classes on ethics in technology but I don't feel they're advanced enough for me. They do ask these sort of questions, however, I feel they don't go very in depth with them. They kind of just ask students these questions to get them started thinking about them. Most of the students in these classes tend to have not thought of these ideas before, and these classes are kind of introducing these questions to them; Whereas I like thinking about them all the time and revisiting these ideas with every a tech news headline that comes out. I'm working on trying to find professors and other students at my university that are also interested in these ideas, but I am wondering if there's also resources online you all may know about that may be helpful in my process. Let me know what you guys think, thanks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS.. Here is my take on the some of the questions above:\n\nCan robots/AI feel emotions?\n\nYes and No. I don't believe that we as humans shouldn't be worried too much about whether robots/AI can or cannot inherently \"feel\" emotion, because I think emotions lie in the eyes of the observer. Let me explain. If a robot is able to mimic the emotions of humans to the level of which it is believable, and we as humans perceive them as real emotions, then they are real emotions. Emotions are not real until we think they are real. When we as people start believing that the robot/AI has felt an emotion, then it has. Because what matters isn't necessarily whether it is literally true or not, but rather what we believe to be true or not. Here is the video clip that taught and inspired me on this from Lex Fridman: [https://youtu.be/0VH1Lim8gL8?t=4603](https://youtu.be/0VH1Lim8gL8?t=4603)\n\nShould we make AI that are meant to replicate people who've died?\n\nThis question is largely the question of the film 'Be Right Back' from Black Mirror. My answer is: there is no objective answer, because AI, like all technology is a tool. What is a tool? A tool is creation that is made to help us achieve a goal better, or faster than before. For example, a wrench is a tool, a car is a tool, a gun is a tool, chatGPT is a tool. The outcome of what is done with these tools can be debated as good or bad, but the tool itself was only a means to the goal. With that being said, an AI that is able replicate a person who was once alive, can be used as a tool to: help someone grieve the lost of a loved one, let someone finish their will, allow malicious people to still be able to spread hate... and so on. The point is, the technology is just a tool, and it is not inherently good or bad.

I've got a few to share, and want to see what you folks come up with. I'm a technical writer/manager in tech, and these were some of the things that popped in my head.   \n\n\n1. Interactive animated chat - Combine HoloLive with AI chat and text to speech, and now you have an animated, live chat with an AI. This requires a few more layers: voice input from the user, detection, chat output and character animation tied to the output. Remembering past responses is also important. \n2. Child/Adult Counseling - Similar to the above, but specifically for counseling. Jimmy may not want to talk to his parents, but he would talk to Kermit the frog, or Iron Man, about his problems. Similarly, the ongoing mental health crisis needs bodies and this could triage and allow people to talk through things. But the AI would require a lot of additional training in counseling specific behavior. \n3. Helpcenters - Online helpcenters are already automated, but an AI responder would be more active. Question is how easily it would be to train into the role; you'd have to give it all the tools it needs, and it needs to be able to remember past responses and utilize them. For anything account related, it'd need a layer of security like human approval for specific actions. \n4. Speechwriting/Basic news reporting - This is pretty self explanatory. ChatGPT is already pretty good at sounding like a politician as it defaults to semi-formal tone, but it can be made even better. And a lot of journalism communications follow such strict rules for reporting that it can be taught to the AI. \n5. White paper/Research paper review - Flip of the script, but if the bot is able to determine good words to use next and use proper grammar, it can also tell you where you're going wrong. Like a more advanced Grammarly. \n6. Translation/auto-translators - If the AI is able to translate accurately, it could be brought with you on trips overseas and whisper in a bluetooth headset what people are saying to you. Or it could be limited to text only, which would also be a huge change. Automate this for Google Translate and other applications and you have a big shakeup as global websites are now accessible to everyone and more accurate.\n7. Basic ad copy/marketing - ChatGPT doesn't recognize the rulesets or quality standards for any of these yet, but it wouldn't take much effort for it to do so. This means you could have it generate a first draft that you then edit into effective copy. Again, the lack of creativity in this kind of writing contributes to why it can be applied. The same can't be said for technical writing however, as the amount of input required to get it right would be more than it would take to just write the content yourself. \n8. Video Games - Combine the first point with interactive characters, and suddenly you have an RPG on steroids. It can respond to your microphone inputs intelligently. This type of game would be smaller in scope and require an internet connection, and maybe some tooling so that you don't get stuck in an endless conversation. Maybe after certain time intervals the AI brings up quest related dialogue written by writers. It can already emulate certain styles etc. But I think this is a long way off at best and again may not be efficient enough. \n9. Bot swarms/upvote farms/echo chambers - Without real account verification, we could see these used nefariously for fake responses in echo chambers throughout the web. We'd need social media to really drill into account verification etc.\n10. AI Books - Currently the AI lacks sufficient creativity and follows a lot of specific behaviors when generating scenes and stories. But it could do vignettes, a series of short stories, etc. This relies entirely upon the input potential: can you tell it to write three chapters about x y z automatically every day with the same characters in a specific setting? Can it extrapolate plotlines, reach satisfying conclusions, and more?\n11. Comedy writing - Sure, it sounds strange, but aren't some of its responses hilarious? Use an outdated version and the bot gives you some really funny lines. It has some wit, because we have some wit. Now you have a factory for offkey humor, randomness, and creativity that's only limited by the amount of time you spend feeding it crazy prompts. I spent a whole afternoon doing this and the responses were amazing. The fact the bot takes itself 100 seriously most of the time lends it to dryer humor or esoterism more than wacky stuff, but it can be a useful tool for a writer out of ideas as its results are completely unexpected. \n12. Online topic papers/education - In a similar vein to counseling above, a bot could be trained to talk about a specific topic, cite sources, and teach a person about a subject. History and other reference topics could be the first steps. One need only continue to drip feed it new discoveries etc. \n13. Movies - Combine everything above, add automated post-production and CGI, and suddenly you have an explosion of movies. You could have it generate every Warhammer 40k book into video, using paid actor voices and likenesses. We've already seen this happening. What happens when the ceiling for investment to create a project is low enough that an entire feature film can be created for just tens of thousands of dollars instead of millions? You could see a site pop up to compete against Youtube, filled with endless content for every piece of written media we've ever made. Or fan projects. And more!\n\nObviously, there's thousands of things that could find applications here. It surprised everyone how effective it was. But it's also still not quite where it needs to be. When it works, it's terrifyingly good, and when it's bad, it makes us question reality itself.

I don't think there is a possibility of a dystopian future where ai dominates humans.  However, there is a fear that artificial intelligence will invade humanity's uniqueness and harm its fundamental enjoyment. I believe that the active pleasure that humans get from producing something is greater than the passive pleasure that we get from consuming something. Assuming that much of this active pleasure comes from the pleasure I produce that is not in this world, but if these outputs that can be produced within human capabilities are produced in advance by AI (AI is not physically constrained, so the output will be much faster than that of humans), I think this pleasure will be greatly diminished. All the reasoning I made in my head, every number of chess I could play, every article I could write would be useless if all these things were already achieved by AI.
