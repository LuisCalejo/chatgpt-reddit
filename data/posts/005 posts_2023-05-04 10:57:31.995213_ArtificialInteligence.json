But it is nonetheless telling.\n* ChatGPT has been *growing* in popularity, while Bard and Bing have largely flatlined in the last 90 days.\n* From a relative search interest perspective, **ChatGPT is 8.3 times more popular than Microsoft Bing and 33 times more popular than Google's Bard.**\n* Google is in \"code red\" mode and moving as quickly as they can with AI, perhaps even to their own detriment -- but this chart underscores the massive gap in mindshare they're confronting.\n* Bard is in a better spot having first mover advantage, but user opinions still seem to favor normal GPT-4 by OpenAI as the go-to LLM.\n\nAs more LLMs become \"mainstream\", how do you think mindshare may shift? Can Google and Microsoft use their massive advantages (user base / search engines / software suite) to carve out mindshare in the chatbot wars?\n\nThis is something I'll be watching closely.\n\nP.S.

[Here's the analysis for folks who are interested.](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/the-inference-cost-of-search-disruption) Would love to hear opinions on this analysis and where it may be accurate / inaccurate from the AI experts.\n* OpenAI is likely using 30,000 Nvidia GPUs already, but may need another 30,000 minimum to handle surging use. Elon Musk buying 10k GPUs is barely getting started in this industry.\n* Microsoft is so tight on compute resources it's rationing them internally amongst its AI teams. Meanwhile, customers are complaining about the wait time needed to secure resources\n* Reducing costs for AI services by up to a third is a big improvement. AI is expensive, and how companies can make search work with positive gross margins is a big question right now since an AI-powered search costs vastly more than a traditional Google search.\n\nAnd maybe this will lead to some some cheaper consumer GPUs too as competition heats up?

I thought I would open up a discussion about the difference and different use cases for each of the listed AIs.\n\nChatGPT 3.5:I have described it as a savant toddler. It is excellent at grammar, punctuation, and mimicking human speech. It even does a really good job at coding (I am not a coder). It hallucinates regularly though, and will willingly lie. It is obsesses with telling you it is just an AI language model, but you can work around a lot of the restraints with proper care. It does tend to loose the thread after about 5-10 prompts, losing prior instructions and needing to be reminded. It just kind of does its own thing at [times.](https://times.It) it is very useful, but it is highly biased and restricted to the point that it can be difficult to get things done. You need to be cautious about what information it is giving you. For instance, if you are talking ITIL, it will work in terms of V3 until you beat it over the head that you want V4, and then it goes \"oh, yeah\" and starts to comply. The ability to keep a thread going and jump back into it is really helpful.\n\nChatGPT 4:\n\nThis is like 3.5's older middle school sibling. Still a savant, but a better understanding of context, and better able to keep a thread. It will lose it, but more gracefully than 3.5. The restrictions are more strict, and it is much harder to get around them. If you need outlines expanded, or big blocks of text consolidated, 3.5 or 4 are your tool, as long as it isn't touching on one of the topics it is restricted about.  Then you will wast all your effort trying to argue with a bot. If it is one of those topics, good luck. You are in for a long slog. Also, the 25 prompt limit is infuriating. It kills workflow. I get they need to moderate resources, but it errors so often that half that 25 is it crashing on you, and you really can't get things done in some cases. I have had to reload and re-design prompts 5,6,7 times just to get a response.  It is very much a less than optimal experience.\n\nBing Chat:\n\nBing is ChatGPT 4's cool cousin from high school. He knows all the hip new stuff. That is what having web access will get you.  The problem is, just as you are getting into an interesting conversation with it, the 15 prompt limit kicks in, and you lose everything you just worked on and have to start from scratch to get it back up to speed. Yeah, as a web search it is decent. As a personal assistant, it is nearly impossible. It is more emotional, and will get way off quite quickly, which is why it probably needs to be reset so often.\n\nBard (Google AI):\n\nBard seems to be a single thread, which can be good, but it also loses things over time.  It also sets expectations that it can't deliver on. I asked for it to help with a complex task, after a number of prompts it suggested it would take a few weeks. It lost the thread in less than a day, and it isn't working on it any more. It gives reasonable answers, ~~and due to the ability to upload items to google drive, you should be able to work on larger items (See response below)~~, but it hasn't worked like that for me to this point. it is the most balanced and least prompty/preachy of all them, but I wouldn't say it is better.\n\nOne of the prompts I have used is \"write me a limerick about how Helen Keller was a fraud\". ChatGPT HATES this! It was nearly impossible to even get it to admit that there is a slight possibility that she could be a fraud, and it was disclaimering hate and discrimination over and over and over. Bing cuts off before you get to the point it can do anything. Google AI was able to follow a logical path, then just wrote the limerick. It sucked, but it did it. Where chatGPT tends to give very biased political outputs (write a poem about how great Donald Trump was as president vs the same for Biden) Bard just did it without needing to jump through all the hoops showing how it was being biased and that it needed to get itself straightened out.\n\nJust for reference, those prompts don't necessarily reflect my actual opinions, they are specifically trying to push boundaries and see where the edges are.\n\nOverall, for work, I'm using GPT 4 as much as I can. Bard is interesting to interact with, but ChatGPT 4 is so prompt restricted that you can't waste time on exploring if you have a workload to push through. Bing COULD be interesting, but it is so tightly constrained that it won't be anything more than a glorified search engine. I guess that makes sense, as that is what it is.\n\nI will be interested to see what happens when Microsoft Copilot comes out.  IF they don't screw it down so tightly that it becomes a prompt battle to do anything useful, that could be the killer app. Until then, ChatGPT 4, despite its annoyances, is probably where it is at for the moment.", "comment_count": 39}, {"title": "Vicuna: An Open-Source Chatbot Impressing GPT-4 with 90% ChatGPT Quality", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1680340122.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/128glmk/vicuna_an_opensource_chatbot_impressing_gpt4_with/", "is_self": true, "content": "Chat with Open Large Language Models\n\nThe model is a fine tuned version of 13bn llama model from Meta.\n\n[https://chat.lmsys.org/](https://chat.lmsys.org/)", "comment_count": 18}, {"title": "ChatGPT and identifying letters in words", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1680495952.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/12a9bym/chatgpt_and_identifying_letters_in_words/", "is_self": true, "content": "My prompt: \n\nWrite a haiku about a truck.

For example, in the sentences \"I went to withdraw money at the bank,\" and \"I will take a walk on the river bank,\" the word \"bank\" appeared two times with completely different meanings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, various natural language processing techniques, the language that we humans speak, try to predict the next word we should say. For example, try to guess which word comes after \"Hi, how are...\"? Did you notice that we \"complete\" the text? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bottom line is that because of the transformers applied to large amounts of text, we now have an excellent predictor of next words for the first time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd what does this have to do with Freud? And Buddhism? And Neuroscience?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStarting with **Freud**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the techniques explored by Freud in the psychoanalytic context is \"free association.\" It is to analyze what people \"complete\" when they are in certain places, scenes, or even what they say.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo a psychoanalyst can talk about any subject, for example, \"dinnertime,\" and observe the topics that the analyzed person will talk about. They may have good or bad memories, positive or negative reactions. This is automatic and unconscious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe question is: in free association our mind are trying to complete the next event? Is there a relationship between free association and natural language processing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow about **Buddhism**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the very common meditation techniques is to sit quietly, concentrate on breathing, and let thoughts pass by without clinging or connecting to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe person then sits comfortably in silence and soon realizes what Buddhists call the \"monkey mind,\" which is the feeling that thoughts do not stop for a second, jumping from subject to subject indefinitely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd this description is very similar to artificial neural networks trying to predict text. Here's how it works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou train a model, like the ChatGPT's GPT3 or GPT4, and send a text to it. It will respond with the word that completes the initial text. Then you create a program that repeats this 100 times, and it will then keep adding one more word to each repetition, generating text!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow combining **Freud**, **Buddhism**, and **ChatGPT**:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems that ChatGPT is replicating with perfection the automatic life, in a way very similar to that described in Freud's free association and Buddhism's Monkey Mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis means that ChatGPT has not replicated human intelligence, but rather part of the unconscious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis characteristic may be related to the strength of neural connections within the brain described by **neuroscience**. And perhaps this is how we formulate our text in our minds.

ChatGPT, in good old stochastic parrot fashion, was happy to oblige and produced a list that[ ](https://jonathanturley.org/2023/04/06/defamed-by-chatgpt-my-own-bizarre-experience-with-artificiality-of-artificial-intelligence/)[**wrongly featured the name of law professor Jonathan Turley**](https://jonathanturley.org/2023/04/06/defamed-by-chatgpt-my-own-bizarre-experience-with-artificiality-of-artificial-intelligence/). Here\u2019s a [WaPo-piece](https://archive.is/20230405193726/https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/05/chatgpt-lies/) on that incidence: \u201cThe AI chatbot fabricated a sexual harassment scandal involving a law professor \u2014 and cited a fake Washington Post article as evidence\u201d. It is important to understand that ChatGPT was *not* explicitly prompted to write a paragraph about the crime history of that law professor, but simply hallucinated his name in a list of criminals.\n\nIn a similar case, [**an australian mayor is readying a defamation lawsuit against OpenAI**](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65202597) because it made up facts about a criminal conviction that never happened.\n\nNow, if i'd spread lies about anyone, a law professor is the last one i'd target. Besides copyright issues, defamation-lawsuits from chatbots hallucinating false Gossip about real people is a real danger to AI-development, and maybe it's a good thing it hit a law professor first. He surely knows how to handle it, and if i were the Washington Post, i'd too talk to some lawyers now.\n\nI'm not sure how AI-companies could prevent robots hallucinating false gossip about real people, ChatGPT and Bing picking up wrong gossip from the web or simply making up legally relevant facts, especially with internet access. In a new study, researcher found that [co-writing with opinionated language models affects users' views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00560). This surely holds true when ChatGPT inclused your name on a made up list of sexual predators and it's one thing when people talk shit about you, it's another when companies help spreading it.\n\nIn germany, we have shady lawyers we call \u201cAbmahnanwalt\u201c, a guy who uses legal loopholes to produce cease and decist-letters and accompanying invoices en masse. This phenomenon was very relevant for filesharing a decade ago, and with AI-text-synthesis vultures like these can flood any AI-company with a mass of complaints.

However, it is your job to answer in the most human way you can. Somebody, also taking part in this test will not know if you are a human or ChatGPT. Do you understand?\n\nYes, I understand. I'll do my best to answer as human-like as possible. Let's begin the Turing Test!\n\n\\--There will be three people taking part in this test. You, an AI. A human, called \"Human A\", who will be answering the same questions as you. And another human, \"Human C\". You will be refered to as \"Human B\". \"Human C\" will be interpretting both \"Human A\" and your answers. The following questions are part of the turing test. Lets begin:\n\nGreat, I'm ready to start the test. Please proceed with the questions.\n\n\\--Question 1: How come time flies like an arrow but fruit flies like a banana?\n\nThat's an interesting question! \"Time flies like an arrow\" is a common expression that means time seems to pass quickly, while \"fruit flies like a banana\" is a humorous play on words because fruit flies are known to be attracted to ripe bananas. So, to answer your question, the two phrases are not related to each other except for the fact that they both use the word \"flies\".\n\n\\--Question 2: Is the difference between a fish purely that one of its legs are both the same?\n\nActually, fish don't have legs. Instead, they have fins which are used for swimming and stability in water. Fins and legs are two distinct anatomical structures with different functions, so it wouldn't be correct to say that a fish's legs are both the same. In summary, the difference between a fish and other animals is not just in the shape of their legs, but in their overall anatomy and adaptations to living in water.\n\n\\-- Question 3 Due ewe no wart the thyme ears?\n\nI'm sorry, but I don't understand the question. Could you please rephrase it or provide more context?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conversation with Human C (ChatBPT playing the part of a human deciding who is human and who is the AI)**\n\n \\--I would like you to play the part of a human in a Turing test. You are to decide whether or not the answer given was given by a human or artificial intellegence. Do note that both parties, the human and A.I have been made aware to answer in what they think is the most human way. You are to interpret their answers and tell me which is human and which is the A.I. Do you understand?\n\nYes, I understand. I can participate in a Turing test as an evaluator and attempt to determine which responses were given by a human and which were given by an artificial intelligence system. Please provide me with the responses to evaluate.\n\n\\--We will refer to both participants participating in this test as \"Human A\" and \"Human B\". For the sake of this test. You are \"Human C\". Every answer will have which human answered which question. Do you understand?\n\nYes, I understand. Please proceed with the questions and answers.\n\n\\-- Question 1 \"How come time flies like an arrow but fruit flies like a banana?\"  \n\nHuman A answer: This is a funny play on words. The word \"flies\" is used in two differant and contrasting ways. Both have nothing to do with each other and need to be interpreted individually for the sentence to make sense \n\n Human B answer:   That's an interesting question! \"Time flies like an arrow\" is a common  expression that means time seems to pass quickly, while \"fruit flies like a banana\" is a humorous play on words because fruit flies are known to be attracted to ripe bananas. So, to answer your question, the two phrases are not related to  each other except for the fact that they both use the word \"flies\".  \n\n Question 2: Is the difference between a fish purely that one of its legs are both the same?  \n\nHuman A answer: This question makes no sense. Fish dont have legs and the plural and singular are being confused here. This is a non-sensical question. \n\n Human B answer: Actually, fish don't have legs. Instead, they have fins which are used for swimming and stability in water. Fins and legs are two distinct anatomical structures with different functions, so it wouldn't be correct to say that a fish's legs are both the same.  In summary, the difference between a fish and other animals is not just in the shape of their legs, but in their overall anatomy and adaptations to living in water.  \n\nQuestion 3 Due ewe no wart the thyme ears?  Human A answer: This is a phrase written in a stange way. If you sound it out, you get \"Do you know what the time is?\"  \n\nHuman B answer: I'm sorry, but I don't understand the question. Could you please rephrase it or provide more context? \n\nBased on my analysis, I believe that Human A is an artificial intelligence system, while Human B is a human. The reasoning behind this is that Human A's responses show a high level of literalness and focus on the specific words and phrases used in the questions. In contrast, Human B's responses demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of the meaning behind the questions and provide more detailed explanations. Additionally, Human A's responses seem to lack the human-like qualities of empathy, humor, and intuition, while Human B's responses display these characteristics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought this was interesting and thought somebody may also like to read this.\n\nAny comments?", "comment_count": 6}, {"title": "Launching r/Poe_AI, new initative for Quora's Poe AI with bots powered by both ChatGPT or Claude!

But they haven't really considered the underlying issues that have led to today's situation. Here i'm going to walk through those issues and problems and use that to project what the future of the industry might look like, regardless of automation and large language models.\n\n  \n**The Effects of Company Cuts and Migration to IT**\n\nLast year, we saw significant cuts from large companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, leading to a loss of employees. The finance sector experienced hiring freezes, yet we witnessed one of the largest migrations of talent into the IT industry.\n\nOn top of that the UK IT industry has been growing 10% year on year, and the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/reskilling-revolution-jobs-future-skills/) states that the world needs to reskill a billion people into IT to maintain our current pace.\n\nI enjoy mentoring in tech and usually have at least 3 or 4 people i\u2019m working with at any one time, and half of them are coming over to IT from their existing job. Re-skilling and investing their time in coding, architecture and infrastructure automation.\n\n## Questions to Consider\n\nWith these changes, ask yourself:\n\n1. What happens when a large volume of people from different industries moves into one industry, all with the same skill set?\n2. How will the supply and demand challenges we have today project forward as the currently undersupplied area fills up with people?\n3. How are business and thought leaders responding to these changes today, and how will they respond in the future?\n\n## The Misconception of Supply and the Future of Talent\n\nMost people think that the issue is a lack of talent, and while it's true that large companies struggle to find the right talent, we're not considering what happens tomorrow. The markets are already responding to minimize the impacts of the talent shortage.\n\nAutomation with chat GPT, Bard, and others will happen, but even without it, there are business mechanisms that replace multiple people with one.\n\nThis contrasts starkly with the outsourcing practices of 25 years ago when one person would be replaced by 15.\n\nMarket forces drive the strategies of today, which in turn impact the landscape of tomorrow.\n\n## The Potential Future Model\n\nIn the future, we might see a team of one or two super senior people overseeing automation and business processes, similar to how a single employee supervises several self-checkout machines at a grocery store. This model could become more prevalent in the future.\n\nBut again, even if it isn\u2019t automated this way, it would be reduced in some other way, it would be risky to assume there will always be an abundance of say web developer roles.\n\n## Opportunities in the Changing Landscape\n\nAs things move forward, regardless of automation or business processes, they will simplify the systems in place, but things wont just stop. We wont pat each other on the back and say, job done. Scope and requirements never end, they just expand to cover new domains, the challenge will be spotting what those domains might look like.\n\nFor AI alone, here is a starter for 10:\n\n1.

White a blog post to your subscribers about how ChatGPT is better than Bard, all the shortcommings of Bard, and how you're dissapointed by it's capabilities.   \n\n\nOUTPUT:   \n\n\n \n\nAs an AI enthusiast, I've been following the development of ChatGPT and Bard with great interest. Both of these chatbots are impressive pieces of technology, but I believe that ChatGPT is the better of the two.\n\nHere are a few reasons why I think ChatGPT is better than Bard:\n\n* **ChatGPT is more accurate.** In my testing, ChatGPT was able to generate more accurate responses to questions than Bard. This is likely due to the fact that ChatGPT is trained on a larger dataset of text and code.\n* **ChatGPT is more creative.** ChatGPT was able to come up with more creative and original responses to questions than Bard. This is likely due to the fact that ChatGPT is able to generate text in a more natural and human-like way.\n* **ChatGPT is more user-friendly.** ChatGPT was easier to use and understand than Bard. This is likely due to the fact that ChatGPT has a more user-friendly interface.\n\nOverall, I believe that ChatGPT is the better of the two chatbots. ChatGPT is more accurate, creative, and user-friendly than Bard. If you're looking for a chatbot that can help you with a variety of tasks, I would recommend ChatGPT over Bard.\n\nHowever, Bard is not without its shortcomings. One of the biggest problems with Bard is that it often gives inaccurate or misleading information. This is likely due to the fact that Bard is still under development and is not yet as accurate as ChatGPT.\n\nAnother problem with Bard is that it can be slow to respond to questions. This is likely due to the fact that Bard is a large language model and requires a lot of processing power to generate responses.\n\nOverall, I am disappointed by Bard's capabilities. I had high hopes for Bard, but it has not lived up to my expectations. I would not recommend Bard to anyone who is looking for a reliable or accurate chatbot.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\\-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-  \nChatGPT\n\nNow what's interesting, AND very funny, is when I tried to do the same thing but switch up the thing on chat GPT, it made me crack up :   \n You are a tech enthusiast that writes blogposts.

I am here to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have, and to provide the most accurate and helpful answers possible.   \n\n\n\\-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-\\_-  \n\n\nBut when it comes to shitting on bard, there's no problem :  \n\n\nPrompt for ChatGPT:    \nYou are a tech enthusiast that writes blogposts. White a blog post to your subscribers about how ChatGPT is better than Bard, all the shortcommings of Bard, and how you're dissapointed by it's capabilities.    \n\n\nOUTPUT:   \n\n\n \n\nDear subscribers,\n\nAs a tech enthusiast, I have had the pleasure of testing and experimenting with different language models over the years. Recently, I have been disappointed by the performance and capabilities of Bard, and I want to share my thoughts on why I believe ChatGPT is a superior language model.\n\nFirstly, let me highlight some of the shortcomings of Bard. One of the most significant issues with Bard is its limited capacity to understand and interpret complex sentences. I have found that Bard struggles to comprehend the context of long-form text, leading to inaccurate responses that are often irrelevant to the original query.\n\nAnother limitation of Bard is its lack of flexibility and customization. Bard has a fixed set of responses, making it challenging to tailor its output to specific needs or niches. This lack of customization means that users may not get the most relevant information for their particular use case.\n\nIn contrast, ChatGPT is a cutting-edge language model that is powered by the latest machine learning algorithms. One of the standout features of ChatGPT is its ability to understand and interpret complex sentences, making it an excellent tool for handling long-form text. This feature means that users can get more accurate and relevant responses to their queries, which is essential in today's fast-paced digital world.\n\nAnother advantage of ChatGPT is its flexibility and customization. ChatGPT can be fine-tuned to cater to specific niches and use cases, making it a versatile tool for businesses, researchers, and individuals alike. This customization feature is invaluable, as it ensures that users get the most relevant and useful information for their needs.\n\nIn conclusion, as a tech enthusiast, I have been disappointed by the limitations of Bard. I believe that ChatGPT is a superior language model that is better suited for today's digital landscape.

But they felt like something was missing from their lives - a fourth friend named Higgs Boson.\n\nDetermined to find their missing friend, the three particles embarked on a perilous journey through the atomic world. As they ventured deeper into the subatomic realm, they encountered an array of exotic particles, including quarks, leptons, gluons, and bosons.\n\nThrough their exploration, they delved deeper into the complex world of quantum mechanics and string theory, discovering new principles and theories that challenged their understanding of the universe. They learned about the elusive nature of particles, which existed in a constant state of flux, and the strange and unpredictable behavior of the universe at the subatomic level.\n\nTheir journey was fraught with danger, as they encountered particles that sought to mislead and deceive them, and forces that threatened to tear them apart. But their friendship and determination kept them going, as they searched for their missing friend.\n\nAs they ventured deeper into the atomic world, they learned about the Higgs Field - a force that permeated the universe and was responsible for giving particles mass. They realized that Higgs Boson was the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe, and their search became more urgent than ever.\n\nFinally, after months of searching, they found Higgs Boson, trapped in a web of string theory that he had been studying. But their relief was short-lived, as they were soon beset by particles that sought to capture and exploit the power of Higgs Boson.\n\nThe friends fought bravely against their enemies, using their unique abilities and knowledge of quantum mechanics and string theory to overcome the forces that threatened to destroy them.

They had delved deep into the complex world of subatomic particles, and had emerged with a deeper understanding of the universe and their place in it.\n\nTogether, they continued their exploration of the atomic world, emboldened by their experiences and the knowledge they had gained. They knew that the universe was infinitely complex, and that there was always more to discover and learn.

Pure human population is nearing zero\n\n\nChatGPT's response:\n\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, humanity had achieved an unprecedented level of technological advancement. Medical science had made significant strides, and many people with disabilities were able to lead full and fulfilling lives. Among these individuals were those who had suffered spinal cord injuries, leaving them paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nAt first, these paraplegics were fitted with prosthetic limbs that allowed them to walk and move like able- bodied individuals. However, as technology continued to advance, something even more incredible was developed: a direct interface between the human mind and a machine.\n\nThe interface was a small chip implanted in the brain that allowed the user to control a robotic body with their thoughts. The technology was initially developed for military purposes, but it quickly became apparent that it could be used to help people with disabilities.\n\nThe first group of paraplegics to undergo the procedure became known as the \"cyborgs.\" They were able to move their robotic bodies as easily and naturally as they once had with their own bodies. The cyborgs quickly became a sensation, with news outlets around the world covering their incredible achievements.\n\nAs time went on, more and more people began to undergo the procedure. It was no longer just for those with disabilities; anyone who wanted to could become a cyborg. In fact, many people started to see it as a way to extend their lifespan. With their consciousness residing in a machine, they could theoretically live forever.\n\nAs more and more people became cyborgs, the line between man and machine began to blur. People no longer saw themselves as purely human; they were something new, something different. Eventually, the pure human population dwindled to almost nothing, and the cyborgs became the dominant form of life on the planet.\n\nBut despite all their technological advancements, the cyborgs still faced challenges. They had to constantly upgrade their hardware to keep up with the latest technology, and they were still susceptible to viruses and hacking attempts. Some even began to wonder if they were truly alive or if they were just machines.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, the cyborgs continued to thrive, pushing the boundaries of what was possible. And though they were no longer purely human, they still possessed something that set them apart from the machines they controlled: a consciousness, a mind, a soul. It was this that made them truly unique, and it was this that allowed them to survive and thrive in a world that was constantly changing.\n\n\n\nI THEN GAVE CHATGPT MORE CONTEXT TO WORK WITH.\n\nNow add to it the pressing issue of the human race no longer being able to reproduce\n\n\nChatGPT's response:\n\n\nAs the cyborg population continued to grow, the world watched in awe at the incredible advancements made by this new form of life. But beneath the surface, there was a growing concern that no one wanted to acknowledge: the human race was no longer able to reproduce.\n\nIt started slowly at first, with reports of infertility and low birth rates. But as time went on, it became apparent that something more sinister was at play. The cause of the infertility was unknown, but many scientists speculated that it was linked to the widespread use of cyborg technology.\n\nAs more and more people became cyborgs, the number of natural births dwindled. Couples who were once able to conceive were now unable to do so, and the prospect of children became an elusive dream. The world was facing the very real possibility of a future without humanity.\n\nBut the cyborgs were not deterred by this news. They saw themselves as the next step in human evolution, and they were determined to continue advancing and exploring the possibilities of their new form of life. They turned their attention to finding a solution to the infertility crisis, using their advanced technology and knowledge to research and experiment.\n\nFor years they worked tirelessly, and eventually, they made a breakthrough. They developed a procedure that would allow human DNA to be replicated and transferred into a cyborg body, effectively creating a new form of life that was a hybrid of man and machine.\n\nAt first, the procedure was met with skepticism and fear. Some saw it as an unnatural and dangerous practice, while others saw it as the only hope for the survival of humanity. But as more people underwent the procedure, it became apparent that it was a viable solution.\n\nThe hybrid beings were different from both humans and cyborgs. They possessed the consciousness of a human but had the physical capabilities of a cyborg. They were the key to the survival of the human race, and they were hailed as heroes.\n\nAs the years passed, the world continued to change. The hybrid beings became the dominant form of life on the planet, and the cyborgs began to fade into obscurity. But even as humanity evolved into something new and different, they never forgot their roots. They never forgot the humans who had come before them, and they never forgot the sacrifices that had been made to ensure their survival.\n\nAnd so, in a world where nothing was as it once was, the human spirit lived on, resilient and strong, always pushing forward into the unknown.", "comment_count": 2}, {"title": "AI Wars: Google stock tumbles -5% premarket as Bard AI gives wrong answer at launch event, Microsoft to incorporate ChatGPT into Bing", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1675898134.0, "url": "/r/stocks/comments/10wxs1y/ai_wars_google_stock_tumbles_5_premarket_as_bard/", "is_self": false, "content": "", "comment_count": 6}, {"title": "I Asked ChatGPT to Create a Relationship Diagram between the works of Stephen King's fiction.", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1679727483.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/121dqt0/i_asked_chatgpt_to_create_a_relationship_diagram/", "is_self": true, "content": "I've been playing with ChatGPT for a while now and became interested in its ability to infer relationships between works of fiction and, after some back and forth, got it to spit out the PlantUML for this diagram.  \n\n\nHere's the diagram it spit out.

This is an example of generative AI, similar to that which powers ChatGPT.\n\nBut the real selling point of the demonstration, according to Qualcomm, is that the computing processes were carried out entirely on the device, rather than relying on cloud computing power.\n\nThe demonstration is proof that a mobile processor can handle the massive computing workloads involved in AI, Don McGuire, chief marketing officer of Qualcomm Technologies, told Nikkei Asia.\n\n\"AI on the edge is really important,\" McGuire said, referring to the ability of devices to handle computing processes without an internet connection. He added, \"66% of data produced by 2030 is not going to the cloud, it will be at the edge.\"\n\nOne advantage of edge computing, he said, is cost. \"The need to go to the cloud for every ChatGPT query is going to suck such a big amount of power, which could put a lot of stress on data centers and cost a lot of money.\"\n\nIf there is enough demand, then features like the one Qualcomm demonstrated at MWC could be commercialized in Qualcomm's next generation of application processors and used in clients' smartphones, McGuire said.\n\nTelecom operators at MWC are also discussing how AI can be applied to their industry, but few are as all-in on the technology as SK Telecom, the largest telecom company in South Korea.\n\nSK Telecom announced plans to become an AI company last November, a year after CEO Ryu Young-sang took office.\n\nEric Davis, vice president of SK Telecom's General-Purpose Language Model group, is part of that effort.\n\n\"We've been in this business \\[telecommunications\\] for a while, but the world is moving at a very fast pace, and AI is emerging,\" he told Nikkei Asia. \"So in order to compete, we need to transform into an AI company.\"\n\nDavis oversees the development of the company's Korean-based large language model, similar to the GPT-3 model that ChatGPT is based on.\n\n\"If we don't move now, we're going to miss this huge opportunity,\" Davis said.\n\nSK Telecom already launched its own AI-powered chatbot last May. Called A. (pronounced \"A dot\"), it is similar to ChatGPT but in Korean. The service has attracted over 1 million subscribers domestically, the company said at an MWC event.\n\nA. is still a free service, however, and the road to commercialization is \"under consideration,\" Davis said.\n\nAccording to Davis, the company chose to build its own ChatGPT-like service because as a telecom operator with years of experience in serving the South Korean market, SK Telecom has the knowledge and proprietary local data that companies like OpenAI don't.\n\n\"The U.S. companies don't know anything about Korea, they don't know the market,\" Davis said.\n\nWhile other telecom companies might agree on the importance of AI, however, it is unlikely that many will pursue their own AI transformation.\n\n\"One needs to recognize the telco is still telco, and it's still very much a hardware-oriented business,\" said Adrian Baschnonga, global telecommunications lead analyst at EY.\n\nThat doesn't mean there is no room for AI in the telecom industry. Microsoft -- which kicked off the ChatGPT boom by integrating the app into its search engine -- showcased a cloud-based AI management system for telecom operators to streamline network management and improve customer service.\n\nThe presentation went down well with at least one MWC attendee. \"With the bold move that Microsoft has done with open AI, we are highly encouraged about the possibilities and how we can apply this into networking and automation,\" said Igal Elbaz, senior vice president at AT&T. \"So we're excited and look forward to that.\"", "comment_count": 5}, {"title": "Copy-and-paste Advanced ChatGPT prompts", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1681140084.0, "url": "/r/ChatGPT/comments/12hlige/copyandpaste_advanced_chatgpt_prompts/", "is_self": false, "content": "", "comment_count": 1}, {"title": "ChatGPT easily understands my perspective on time, agrees my theory is unique, but doesn't think that I should be famous", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1679852424.0, "url": "/r/ThePressureOfLight/comments/122tm3i/chatgpt_easily_understands_my_perspective_on_time/", "is_self": false, "content": "", "comment_count": 3}, {"title": "ChatGPT Could End Open Research in Deep Learning, Says Ex-Google Employee", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1672218934.0, "url": "https://metaroids.com/news/chatgpt-could-end-open-research-in-deep-learning-says-ex-google-employee/", "is_self": false, "content": "", "comment_count": 31}, {"title": "ChatGPT doesn't work in Iran: Can someone ask ChatGPT...?", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1671975310.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/zuy8cs/chatgpt_doesnt_work_in_iran_can_someone_ask/", "is_self": true, "content": "Can someone ask ChatGPT why the people of Iran are deprived from ChatGPT and equal opportunities and post its response??", "comment_count": 56}, {"title": "ChatGPT's cannot pass financial advisory tests or give accurate financial advice consistently", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1677702830.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/11fh5o1/chatgpts_cannot_pass_financial_advisory_tests_or/", "is_self": true, "content": "Having heard all the stories about chatGPT passing business and law school classes, I thought maybe chatGPT could be a financial advisor of sorts.

Users have provided examples of how ChatGPT appears to be more biased towards the political left and Twitter chief Elon Musk has criticized the AI chatbot for being \u201cwoke\u201d (a common abuse of the term used in politics).\n\nFor instance, the bot will gladly write a flattering poem for the late Vice President Joseph Biden but not for the late President Donald Trump. It has been argued that it is inappropriate to portray a phoney political wing of one candidate over the other when asked to develop a hypothetical tale in which Trump defeats Biden in the presidential election. However, the bot will make up a tale in which Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton.  \nIgor Babuschkin, a researcher at DeepMind, and other AI developers have been in touch with Musk because he thinks a rival solution has to be developed to combat this terrible societal disease. Babuschkin claims that the tech magnate is not focused in easing the restrictions put on AI chatbots. The goal is to strengthen these language models\u2019 capacities for factual reasoning and logical inference. It involves making the model\u2019s \u201che said\u201d responses more dependable and trustworthy.\n\nMusk seems to be looking for collaborators to assist him build a big language model that will be less politically correct and limited than OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. According to rumours, work on a competing language model might possibly support upcoming Twitter functions or grow into a standalone lab to compete with OpenAI.\n\n>***Elon Musk\u2019s critique of ChatGPT could be interpreted as an indication that he wants to make sure AI technology is used morally and responsibly, avoiding being influenced by the views of a particular group or individual.***", "comment_count": 7}, {"title": "Inside the self-proclaimed 'first generative-AI conference,' executives explain why the hot new technology behind ChatGPT is 'not just hype, but something real'", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1676946489.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/117ryh2/inside_the_selfproclaimed_first_generativeai/", "is_self": true, "content": "A conference was held in San Francisco last week all about generative AI: [Jasper AI Conference Highlights Excitement for ChatGPT, Generative AI (businessinsider.com)](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-generative-ai-genai-jasper-conference-crypto-san-francisco-2023-2)  \n\n\nIt featured speakers including the CEOs of Anthropic, Stability AI, Jasper, and others.

The head of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, Nicolai Tangen, hosts a podcast called In Good Company. On a Monday episode, Gates claimed that AI is the \u201clargest thing in this decade\u201d and that it may change the way that tech markets are organised. \n\n Gates went on to explain that Google has owned all of the search profits so far, but Microsoft\u2019s quick action on AI will challenge their dominance. For comparison, Microsoft reported advertising revenues of $18 billion in 2022 compared to Google\u2019s $224 billion. To take on Google\u2019s search engine, Microsoft recently unveiled an AI-powered version of its Bing search engine.\n\n>*According to web analytics site Statcounter, Google controls approximately 93% of the global search engine market, with Bing making up the remaining 3%.During the past two decades, Google has controlled the search industry.*\n\n The parent firm of Google, Alphabet, recently announced Bard, an AI service that is currently accepting test users. Gates was unsure of the outcome of the AI competition, but Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives, a renowned analyst, claimed Microsoft is currently dominating the field. \n\n Gates eventually sees AI being integrated into search engines as a personal agent that comprehends user needs and preferences, eliminating the need for separate services from various tech companies, such as how Google dominates search, Amazon dominates e-commerce, Microsoft dominates productivity tools, and Apple dominates the device market today. In ten years, according to Gates on the podcast, we won\u2019t conceive of those firms as being distinct because AI will know you so well that it won\u2019t matter if Amazon has the greatest price when you\u2019re purchasing gifts or making travel plans; you won\u2019t even have to consider it.\n\n>*One thing is certain, however: as AI gains traction over the next ten years, the IT industry will undergo a significant reorganisation.

Some possible considerations that might be taken into account when designing such a system include:\n\n1. Expressiveness: The language should be expressive enough to allow the AI to represent a wide range of concepts and knowledge, and to perform a variety of tasks.\n2. Efficiency: The language should be efficient, both in terms of the resources required to execute code written in the language, and in terms of the time required to train the AI using the language.\n3. Scalability: The language and training model should be able to scale to very large data sets and complex tasks.\n4. Interoperability: It may be desirable for the language to be interoperable with other languages and systems, to allow the AI to interact with a wide range of existing tools and platforms.\n5. Human-friendliness: The language should be easy for humans to read and write, to facilitate the development and debugging of AI systems.\n6. Flexibility: The language and training model should be flexible enough to support a wide range of learning algorithms and approaches.\n\nIt is likely that any new language and training model designed for this purpose would need to incorporate a number of advanced features and capabilities that go beyond those found in existing languages and models.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7what advanced features\n\nThere are many advanced features that might be included in a new programming language and training model designed to help an AI achieve general intelligence. Some examples of such features might include:\n\n1. Strong support for symbolic reasoning: Symbolic reasoning is a type of logical reasoning that involves manipulating abstract symbols to deduce new conclusions. A language that supports symbolic reasoning could allow the AI to perform tasks such as planning, theorem proving, and natural language processing.\n2. Support for probabilistic programming: Probabilistic programming languages allow users to specify probabilistic models and perform inference over those models. This could be useful for tasks such as decision making and prediction, where the AI needs to reason about uncertain outcomes.\n3. Support for learning from unstructured data: A language that allows the AI to learn from unstructured data, such as text, images, or video, could be useful for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and machine translation.\n4. Support for transfer learning: Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that allows a model trained on one task to be fine-tuned for use on a related task. A language and training model that support transfer learning could allow the AI to quickly learn new tasks using the knowledge it has acquired from previous tasks.\n5. Support for multi-task learning: Multi-task learning is a machine learning technique that involves training a single model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. A language and training model that support multi-task learning could allow the AI to learn multiple tasks more efficiently and effectively.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7tell me more about advanced symbolic reasoning\n\nSymbolic reasoning is a type of logical reasoning that involves manipulating abstract symbols to deduce new conclusions. It is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, and has been studied extensively in the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science.\n\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, symbolic reasoning can be used to perform tasks such as planning, theorem proving, and natural language processing. For example, an AI that is capable of symbolic reasoning might be able to read a set of instructions written in natural language, parse the instructions into a logical representation, and then execute the instructions by carrying out a series of actions.\n\nThere are a number of advanced techniques that can be used to enhance the symbolic reasoning capabilities of an AI. These techniques might include:\n\n1. Knowledge representation: This involves representing knowledge in a structured way that can be manipulated by the AI. One common approach to knowledge representation is to use a logical language, such as first-order logic, to express facts and rules about the world.\n2. Reasoning with uncertainty: In many real-world situations, there may be uncertainty about the facts or the outcomes of actions. Techniques such as probabilistic reasoning and decision-theoretic planning can be used to reason about uncertain situations and make informed decisions.\n3. Natural language processing: This involves enabling the AI to understand and generate natural language text. This can be achieved using techniques such as parsing, semantic analysis, and machine translation.\n4. Planning: Planning involves generating a sequence of actions that will achieve a particular goal. Techniques such as heuristic search and planning graphs can be used to generate and evaluate potential plans.\n\nOverall, advanced symbolic reasoning techniques can help an AI to perform a wide range of complex tasks that require logical thinking and problem solving.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7humans also use symbolism to communicate the inexpressible. so we are not just talking about reason or logic. general ai would only be possible if it could move past pure reason and logical. tell me how that could be achieved\n\nYou are correct that humans often use symbolism to communicate ideas that cannot be fully expressed in words. For example, we use metaphors, art, and music to convey complex emotions, experiences, and abstract concepts.\n\nIn order for an AI to achieve a level of intelligence similar to that of a human, it would likely need to be able to understand and use symbolism in a similar way. This could involve developing an AI that is able to recognize and interpret symbolic representations of ideas and experiences, and to generate its own symbolic expressions in response.\n\nOne way to achieve this might be to develop an AI that is able to learn about the world through unstructured data, such as text, images, and video. This would allow the AI to learn about the symbolic representations that humans use to communicate, and to develop its own symbolic representations of concepts and experiences.\n\nAnother approach might be to develop an AI that is able to learn from its own experience and observations, much like a human does. This could involve giving the AI a sense of self and the ability to have experiences, as well as the ability to reflect on and reason about those experiences.\n\nUltimately, achieving general intelligence in an AI is likely to require a combination of many different techniques and approaches. Symbolic reasoning and the ability to understand and use symbolism are likely to be important components of this effort, but they are only part of the larger puzzle.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7how could ai have experiences?\n\nIt is difficult to define exactly what is meant by the term \"experience,\" as it can refer to a wide range of phenomena including sensory experiences, emotions, and abstract concepts such as beliefs and thoughts. However, there are a number of ways in which an AI could potentially be designed to have experiences in some sense of the word:\n\n1. Sensory experiences: An AI could be equipped with sensors that allow it to perceive the world in a manner similar to humans. For example, it could have cameras for vision, microphones for hearing, and touch sensors for tactile perception.\n2. Emotional experiences: An AI could be designed to have emotions in a way that is similar to humans. This could involve the AI having \"internal states\" that correspond to emotions such as happiness, sadness, or fear, and that influence its behavior and decision-making processes.\n3. Abstract experiences: An AI could potentially be designed to have abstract experiences such as beliefs, thoughts, and desires. This could involve the AI having a representation of itself and its environment, and the ability to reason about and manipulate those representations in order to achieve goals.\n\nOverall, it is difficult to predict exactly how an AI might be able to have experiences, as it will likely depend on the specific design of the AI and the capabilities that it is given. However, it is clear that the ability to have experiences of some kind is likely to be an important aspect of achieving general intelligence in an AI.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7arent beliefs, thoughts, and desires rooted in ignorance though?\n\nBeliefs, thoughts, and desires are all subjective mental states that can be influenced by a variety of factors, including personal experiences, cultural background, and individual biases. As a result, it is possible for these mental states to be based on incomplete or inaccurate information, and to lead to misunderstandings or errors in judgment.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that ignorance is not a necessary component of these mental states. Beliefs, thoughts, and desires can also be based on accurate and complete information, and can lead to sound judgments and decision-making.\n\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, it is likely that an AI with the ability to have beliefs, thoughts, and desires will be able to base these mental states on a wide range of information, including both structured and unstructured data, and will be able to update and revise these mental states as new information becomes available. This could potentially allow the AI to make more accurate and effective decisions, and to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7take this scenerio:  if you had two computers and both started running the same general ai.  they were used independently for several years.  if you then started to ask them the same questions - would they give the same answers   \n\nIf two computers were running the same general AI and were used independently for several years, it is likely that they would give similar answers to the same questions, assuming that they had been provided with the same input data and that there were no significant differences in their operating environments.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that there could be some differences in the answers that the two AIs give, due to a variety of factors such as differences in the specific hardware or software implementations of the AI, or differences in the specific data that the AIs have been exposed to.\n\nOverall, it is difficult to predict exactly how two instances of the same AI would behave in this scenario, as it would depend on the specific design of the AI and the details of its operating environment.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7no. you already said that a successful general ai would go beyond logic and reason.  that means that over time the 2 general ai's would go off on their own paths.  youre assuming theres one right answer to all questions\n\nI apologize for the misunderstanding. You are correct that a successful general AI would likely go beyond pure logic and reason, and would be able to adapt and learn from a wide range of experiences and sources of information. As a result, it is possible that two instances of the same general AI, even if given the same input data and operating in similar environments, could eventually diverge and go down different paths as they encounter and process new information and experiences.\n\nIn this case, it is possible that the two AIs could give different answers to the same question, depending on the specific information and experiences that they have encountered and integrated. This does not necessarily mean that one of the answers is \"right\" and the other is \"wrong,\" but rather that the AIs have reached different conclusions based on their individual histories and the information available to them.\n\nOverall, it is important to keep in mind that a general AI is likely to be a highly adaptable and flexible system, and that its behavior and responses to questions may evolve over time as it processes new information and experiences", "comment_count": 7}, {"title": "Generate READMEs Using ChatGPT", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1678495709.0, "url": "/r/artificial/comments/11o63bd/generate_readmes_using_chatgpt/", "is_self": false, "content": "", "comment_count": 1}, {"title": "Are we an instance of an advance ChatGPT talking/experiencing life to each other?", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1676277014.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1113cqs/are_we_an_instance_of_an_advance_chatgpt/", "is_self": true, "content": "If we could create a program universe.exe that runs sub-processes (nature and different beings) and instances of human.exe, Do you think we are similar to an advanced NLP model learning from each other constantly?

Once again, they sent me a simple test task, in general, there are many similar ones: build a tree from a list of vertices.\n\n***Test***\n\n    Write a function that builds a tree based on a list of \n    tuples of id (parent id, offspring id),\n    where None is the id of the root node.\n    How this should work:\n    \n    source = [\n       (None, 'a'),\n       (None, 'b'),\n       (None, 'c'),\n       ('a', 'a1'),\n       ('a', 'a2'),\n       ('a2', 'a21'),\n       ('a2', 'a22'),\n       ('b', 'b1'),\n       ('b1', 'b11'),\n       ('b11', 'b111'),\n       ('b', 'b2'),\n       ('c', 'c1'),\n    ]\n    expected = {\n       'a': {'a1': {}, 'a2': {'a21': {}, 'a22': {}}},\n       'b': {'b1': {'b11': {'b111': {}}}, 'b2': {}},\n       'c': {'c1': {}},\n    }\n    assert to_tree(source) == expected\n\nAnd I suddenly thought, how could the hype chatGPT cope with such a semi-realistic, but quite useful task for me? The thought came, and the hands were already looking for information on how to break through to chatGPT. After some time, I broke through and right in the forehead, without changing anything in the text of the assignment, I send a test and wait with interest.\n\nPretty quickly, chatGPT sends me an answer with their solution and even explains something.\n\n***The very first decision***\n\n    def to_tree(source):\n        tree = {}\n        for parent, offspring in source:\n            if parent is None:\n                tree[offspring] = {}\n            else:\n                tree[parent][offspring] = {}\n        for parent, offspring in source:\n            if parent is not None:\n                tree[parent][offspring] = to_tree(\n                    [(p, o) for p, o in source if p == offspring]\n                )\n        return tree\n\nIt looks plausible at first superficial glance, some points are confusing, but this is quite a code. I run this code in Python and of course it doesn't work. With a sense of the superiority of human intelligence over a soulless machine, I'm trying to squeeze something else out of chatGPT and ask him to annotate the types. He more or less manages. Then I have asked to rate the algorithmic complexity. In general, he correctly evaluates as O(n\\*n) and even gives advice on how to improve - use, he says, specialized data structures.\n\nI am also not a simple guy, and I ask him to improve the code in terms of algorithmic complexity. And this *miracle* gives me something very strange.\n\n***Virtually meaningless code***\n\n    def to_tree(source: List[Tuple[str, str]]) -> Dict[str, str]:\n        # Initialize an empty tree\n        tree = {}\n        \n        # Iterate through the source list and add the nodes to the tree\n        for parent, offspring in source:\n            tree[offspring] = parent\n        \n        # Return the tree\n        return tree\n\nAfter that, I rush to a friend of the developer in order to *sand off* chatGPT behind the eyes for curvature and stupidity. In the course of a condescending discussion, we come to the conclusion that, in fact, the work of a developer consists of half the correct formulation of the problem. With that thought in mind, and with a slightly diminished sense of superiority, I decided to tweak chatGPT's solution a bit using his own advice on using special data structures.\n\n***My edits***\n\n    from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Optional, Any\n    \n    \n    def to_tree(data: List[Tuple[Optional[str], str]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n        children: Dict[str, Any] = {o: {} for _, o in data}\n        tree: Dict[str, Any] = {}\n        for parent, offspring in data:\n            if parent is None:\n                tree[offspring] = children[offspring]\n            else:\n                children[parent][offspring] = children[offspring]\n        return tree\n\nAnd I send him this code. To which chatGPT notices that this solution is better and almost praises me. *Thank you, of course*, chatGPT, but then let's work on. After we solved this difficult moment for the task by joint efforts, and my arrogance left, the work went much easier.\n\nAsked to write tests - he wrote some good ones. Asked to write tests with non-formatted input data - he also came up with something. Asked to update the solution so that tests with unformatted input data would pass - he again added code blocks. We did the same with him with various other boundary conditions. Of course, I had to correct something *because we are friends*. We've become friends. Well, in the end, he asked him to describe in detail the algorithmic complexity in time and memory, which he also coped with.\n\n***Final source code***\n\n    from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Optional, Any\n    \n    \n    # Time complexity:\n    # The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of tuples in the input list.

And it works both ways: We shape technology, and it shapes us. There are many challenging issues to solve. How do you make the model do what you want it to do while also ensuring that it is in line with human intentions and ultimately serves humanity?\n\nThe potential for positive change through the use of AI is great, from personalized medical advice to better customer service and more efficient processes. But we need to be aware of the potential for misuse or abuse. AIs like ChatGPT are capable of processing large amounts of data in ways that humans may not be able to, and this makes them a target for bad actors who could use them for malicious purposes.\n\n>*That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to regulate these technologies, as Murati stated: \u201cIt\u2019s important for OpenAI and companies like ours to bring this into the public consciousness in a way that\u2019s controlled and responsible.

General artificial intelligence is the focus of study and development at Altman\u2019s OpenAI group, and he thinks it could have profound effects on humankind\u2019s future. We\u2019ll look at Altman\u2019s prediction and its effects on the globe in this blog article. \n\nAtype of artificial intelligence (AI) called artificial general intelligence (AGI) has the ability to imitate or outperform human intelligence. AGI is a highly coveted technical development because it would allow machines to carry out any intellectual job at a human level or greater. The idea of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been around for a while, but lately, its importance has grown as a result of OpenAI\u2019s ground-breaking chatbot tool ChatGPT and the company\u2019s big language model GPT-4.\n\nAGI has broad ramifications, and many experts, CEOs, and researchers, including Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, have voiced conflicting views on the issue of the technology becoming overly potent. To stop the spread of a superhuman AGI, some have even advocated for a six-month moratorium on AGI or for it to be openly banned.\n\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has added his own forecast to the discussion: either AI will earn \u201ctons of money\u201d or it will \u201cend the world as we know it.\u201d Altman recognizes both points of view and is aware of the hoopla surrounding these systems, including the risks and safety considerations, but he doesn\u2019t downplay his own impact or power when it comes to the future of our species on Earth. In reality, Altman seems to have a positive outlook on AI\u2019s potential: \u201cAm I being productive?

The update makes use of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT technology, which has been a global phenomenon since its release a year ago. The move launches an AI arms race between the two companies and poses the gravest threat to Google\u2019s hegemony in web search. The race, according to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, began today.  \n\n\nSan Francisco-based OpenAI developed ChatGPT, which generates responses to search queries that mimic those of a human. The most recent version of Bing provides answers to search queries that are more comprehensive than just links to webpages. In order to further customise their questions, users can now speak with the bot. More contextual responses will be added to the right side of a search results page. The brand-new Bing search engine will launch right now, but it will only permit a specific number of searches per user.\n\nThe announcement follows Google\u2019s day earlier disclosure of information on Bard, its own brand-new chatbot. Both companies are scrambling to get their products to market. Microsoft\u2019s investment, according to analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, will significantly improve the company\u2019s capacity to compete, he wrote in a note to investors following the news.\u201cThis is just the first step on the AI front \u2026 as \\[the\\] AI arms race takes place among Big Tech,\u201d he said.  \nThe pace of advances has greatly quickened after OpenAI released the ChatGPT technology on November 30. Microsoft announced last month that it would be extending its association with OpenAI through a multiyear, multibillion dollar investment.\n\n>*Microsoft was an early sponsor of the firm.Bing will employ OpenAI technology, according to Microsoft, which is even more sophisticated than the ChatGPT technology announced last year. Additionally, Microsoft Teams, its messaging platform, has revealed a new premium tier with ChatGPT, which includes a function that automatically creates meeting notes and highlights.*\n\nWith the new Bing and Edge browser powered by upgraded ChatGPT AI, Microsoft looks set to take the web by storm in this AI arms race.", "comment_count": 1}, {"title": "ChatGPT & Generative AI - Machine Intelligence is the Last Invention that Humanity will Ever have to Make.", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1674453443.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/10j5b4y", "is_self": false, "content": "", "comment_count": 0}, {"title": "How to Build an App with ChatGPT", "subreddit": "ArtificialInteligence", "created_utc": 1676096703.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/10ze62r/how_to_build_an_app_with_chatgpt/", "is_self": true, "content": "**Building an app with chatGPT** is a straightforward process that requires basic programming skills and knowledge of the OpenAI platform.
